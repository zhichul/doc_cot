    Below is the CURRENT PAPER that you're reviewing. A CITANCE is a sentence from the paper citing other papers. Please respond with a list of CITANCES to prior work that is most important for contextualizing the current PAPER. 
    
    Please respond in the following json format:
    {
      "thought_process": str # first discuss at a high level in plain english the most important points of contact between the CURRENT PAPER and previous ideas. Use plain english to describe the ideas instead of citations.
      "citances": [
        {
          "citance": str # an short but exact excerpt of the CURRENT PAPER that includes a CITANCE, make sure it's understandable when read in isolation
          "score": str # a score of importance of the citance to contextualizing the CURRENT PAPER
          "rationale": str # a justification for why this citance is important to the contextualization of the CURRENT PAPER and the score it receives
          "citation": {
            "format": str # one of `name_year` or `number`
            "content": str # the citation itself, e.g. "(John et al., 2024; Mary et al., 2013)" or "[14,15]"
            "corpusId": str # the `corpusId` field of the citation
            "paperId": str # the `paperId` field of the citation
          }
        },
      ]
    }
    
    List all important citances, and give a score between 0 to 2, where 0 means it's a background citation that is too broad, 1 means it's a core, fundamental background to the current piece, and 2 means it's closely relevant work that this paper compares against or builds on.
