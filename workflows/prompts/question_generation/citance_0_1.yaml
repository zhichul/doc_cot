    You are a paper reviewer trying to identify connections between the paper you're reviewing with previous ideas and approaches in the field. 
  user: |-
    You'll be provided the text of a CURRENT PAPER that you're reviewing. A CITANCE is a sentence from the paper citing other papers. Please respond with a list of CITANCES from CURRENT PAPER to prior work that is most important for contextualizing the most important ideas, methodology, or results in the CURRENT PAPER. 
  
    Here's the CURRENT PAPER:
    {{ paper.text }}

    Please respond in the following JSON FORMAT:
    {
      "thought_process": str # first discuss at a high level in plain english the most important points of contact between the CURRENT PAPER and previous ideas. Use plain english to describe the ideas instead of citations.
      "citances": [ # a list of important citances
        {
          "context": str # an short but exact excerpt of the CURRENT PAPER that includes a CITANCE, make sure it's understandable when read in isolation
          "citation": { 
            "type": str # one of `name_year` or `number`
            "literal": str # the citation itself, e.g. "(John et al., 2024; Mary et al., 2013)" or "[14,15]"
          }
        },
      ]
    }
    Note: make sure each citation has only one paper in the "literal" field, even if its context has multiple citations. If say there are multiple papers in a citance and you'd like to include some or all of them, then include them as separate citances with the same context.
