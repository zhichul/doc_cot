    You are a paper reviewer trying to identify connections between the paper you're reviewing with previous ideas and approaches in the field.

    Below is the CURRENT PAPER that you're reviewing and a paper that it CITES. 
    Below is also the CITANCE, which is the context containing a citation to the CITED PAPER.

    Please respond with a list of CONNECTIONS between the two papers. A connection is a similarity between the two papers. Some example connections include related purpose, method, finding, or insight. 

    Please respond in the following json format:
    {
      "thought_process": str # first discuss how the two papers are related at a high level, this should help you come up with more detailed connections
      "connections": [
        {
          "connection": # detailed description of the connection between a paper
          "score": str # a score of quality of the question
          "rationale": str # a justification for why this question yields the same answer on both papers, and the score it receives
        },
      ]
    }
    

    List all important connections, and give a score between 0 to 2, where 0 means it's erroneous, 1 means it's superficial and many other papers would be connected in the same way, and 2 means it touches the core of the relationship between the two papers, and it's unlikely that many other papers would have the same connection.

    <current_paper>
    {{ paper.text }}
    </current_paper>

    <cited_paper>
    {{ citance.citation.paper.text }}
    </cited_paper>

    <citance>
    {{ citance.context }}
    </citance>

    Additional instructions: The connection should avoid idiosyncratic terminology as much as possible, but should instead use language where a reader unfamiliar with the paper but is genearlly well-read in the field should be able to understand.
