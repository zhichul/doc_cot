    "thought_process": "The CURRENT PAPER proposes a Distributional Approach for Controlled Text Generation, which allows for both pointwise and distributional constraints to be specified. The CITED PAPER, on the other hand, discusses Sequence Level Training with Recurrent Neural Networks for text generation tasks. The CITANCE mentions prior work that uses Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize global objectives, such as BLEU and ROUGE, for Machine Translation and Summarization. This suggests that both papers are related to text generation and optimization of language models. To come up with questions, I will consider the similarities and differences between the two papers, such as their approaches to text generation, optimization objectives, and evaluation metrics.",

            "answer": "Reinforcement Learning plays a crucial role in optimizing language models by allowing them to learn from rewards or penalties. The CITED PAPER uses RL to optimize metrics like BLEU and ROUGE, while the CURRENT PAPER does not explicitly use RL but instead proposes a Distributional Approach that can be seen as a form of implicit RL. The CURRENT PAPER's method can be viewed as learning to optimize a reward function that is implicit in the distributional constraints."

The CURRENT PAPER, on the other hand, uses metrics like KL divergence and constraint satisfaction. The use of different metrics implies that the papers are optimizing for different aspects of text generation, with the CITED PAPER focusing on fluency and coherence, and the CURRENT PAPER focusing on constraint satisfaction and diversity."
