    "thought_process": "The current paper discusses controlled text generation using a distributional approach, which allows for both pointwise and distributional constraints to be specified. The cited paper, 'Plug and Play Language Models: A Simple Approach to Controlled Text Generation', proposes a method for controlled text generation using a pre-trained language model and one or more simple attribute classifiers. The citance mentions a KL penalty used by Dathathri et al. (2020), which is related to the topic of controlled text generation. The current paper and the cited paper both deal with controlling the output of a language model to meet certain constraints or attributes. To come up with questions that have identical answers for both papers, we need to focus on the aspects that are common to both, such as the use of constraints, the importance of fluency and diversity in generated text, and the challenges of controlling a language model's output.",
