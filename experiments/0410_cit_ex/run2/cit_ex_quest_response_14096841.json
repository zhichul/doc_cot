    "thought_process": "The CURRENT PAPER proposes a Distributional Approach to Controlled Text Generation, which permits specifying both pointwise and distributional constraints over the target language model. The CITED PAPER proposes an Actor-Critic Algorithm for Sequence Prediction, which uses a critic network to predict the value of an output token given the policy of an actor network. Both papers aim to improve the quality of generated text by optimizing a task-specific score, such as BLEU or ROUGE. The CITANCE mentions prior work that uses Reinforcement Learning (RL) to induce autoregressive models to optimize global objectives using task-specific rewards, which is related to the CITED PAPER's use of an actor-critic algorithm.",
