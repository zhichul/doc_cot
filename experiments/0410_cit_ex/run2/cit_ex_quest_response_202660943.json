    "thought_process": "The current paper discusses controlled text generation using a distributional approach, which involves specifying constraints on the target language model and minimizing KL divergence from the initial model distribution. The cited paper, 'Fine-Tuning Language Models from Human Preferences', applies reward learning to natural language tasks, such as continuing text with positive sentiment or physically descriptive language, and summarization tasks. The citance mentions Jaques et al. (2017) and Ziegler et al. (2019), who propose a conservative fine-tuning approach using a KL penalty to discourage large deviations from the original language model. To find questions with identical answers for both papers, we can look for aspects that are related to controlled text generation, language models, and fine-tuning approaches.",
