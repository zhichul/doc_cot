    "thought_process": "To find questions that have identical answers for the CURRENT PAPER and the CITED PAPER, we need to analyze the relationship between the two papers. The CURRENT PAPER proposes a Distributional Approach for Controlled Text Generation, which involves a constraint satisfaction problem combined with a divergence minimization objective. The CITED PAPER introduces Global Autoregressive Models (GAMs) for data-efficient sequence learning, which combines an autoregressive component with a log-linear component. Both papers deal with autoregressive models and their limitations, and both propose methods to improve their performance. The DPG algorithm is mentioned in the CURRENT PAPER as a technique suitable for sampling from a sequential EBM, which is also related to the GAMs in the CITED PAPER.",
