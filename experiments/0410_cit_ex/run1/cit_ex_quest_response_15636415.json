    "thought_process": "The CURRENT PAPER proposes a Distributional Approach for controlled text generation, which permits specifying both pointwise and distributional constraints over a target language model. The CITED PAPER proposes Sequence Tutor, a method for improving the structure and quality of sequences generated by a recurrent neural network (RNN) while maintaining information originally learned from data. Both papers aim to balance the trade-off between satisfying constraints and preserving the diversity of generated samples. The CITANCE mentions Jaques et al. (2017) and Ziegler et al. (2019), which propose using a KL penalty to moderate the fine-tuning of a language model, similar to the approach taken in the CITED PAPER. Based on this, questions can be asked about the papers' approaches to controlled text generation, their use of KL penalties, and their evaluation metrics.",
