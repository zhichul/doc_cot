    "thought_process": "The current paper proposes a distributional approach to controlled text generation, which allows specifying both pointwise and distributional constraints on the target language model. The cited paper, 'Plug and Play Language Models: A Simple Approach to Controlled Text Generation' by Dathathri et al. (2020), uses a plug-and-play approach to combine a pre-trained language model with a simple attribute classifier to control text generation. The citance mentions the use of a KL penalty in the cited paper, which is also a key component in the current paper. This suggests that both papers explore methods for controlling text generation, but with different approaches. The questions that can be asked of papers and have identical answers for both papers are likely to be related to the general topic of controlled text generation, language models, and evaluation metrics.",

            "rationale": "Both papers use KL divergence as a key component, either as a penalty term or as a measure of divergence between the target and original distributions. This question touches on the core of the relationship between the two papers and is unlikely to have the same answer for many other papers.",
            "answer": "KL divergence plays a crucial role in controlled text generation, either as a penalty term to prevent degeneration or as a measure of divergence between the target and original distributions."
