    "thought_process": "The CURRENT PAPER proposes a Distributional Approach for controlled text generation, which allows for both pointwise and distributional constraints. The CITED PAPER discusses a related approach for energy-based sequential models, also using a Distributional Reinforcement Learning perspective. The CITANCE specifically mentions the DPG algorithm from the CITED PAPER as an inspiration for the CURRENT PAPER's KL-adaptive version of the DPG algorithm. This suggests that both papers are working on similar problems, but with different focuses and applications. Therefore, questions that can be asked of papers that would have identical answers for both the CURRENT PAPER and the CITED PAPER might include those related to the use of energy-based models, distributional reinforcement learning, and the DPG algorithm.",
