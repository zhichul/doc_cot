    "thought_process": "The current paper and the cited paper are related in the sense that they both deal with fine-tuning language models to achieve specific goals. The current paper proposes a distributional approach to controlled text generation, while the cited paper discusses fine-tuning language models from human preferences. The citance mentions conservative fine-tuning approaches that use a KL penalty to discourage large deviations from the original language model, which is similar to the current paper's goal of minimizing KL divergence from the initial language model distribution. This suggests that both papers are concerned with balancing the need to adapt a language model to a new task or preference with the need to preserve the model's original characteristics.",
