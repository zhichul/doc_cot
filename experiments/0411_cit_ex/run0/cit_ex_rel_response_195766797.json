    "thought_process": "To find connections between the two papers, we first need to understand the main ideas and contributions of each paper. The current paper proposes a distributional approach to controlled text generation, which allows for specifying both pointwise and distributional constraints over a target language model. The cited paper, on the other hand, presents a method for off-policy batch reinforcement learning, which is applied to the problem of open-domain dialog generation. One potential connection between the two papers is the use of KL-divergence as a regularization technique. In the current paper, KL-divergence is used to penalize deviations from the original language model, while in the cited paper, KL-control is used to regularize the policy updates in the reinforcement learning algorithm.",
