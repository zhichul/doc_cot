The current paper proposes a Distributional Approach for controlled text generation, which involves specifying constraints on the target language model and minimizing the KL divergence from the initial model distribution. The cited paper, on the other hand, presents an actor-critic algorithm for sequence prediction, which is also related to text generation. By examining the citance, we can see that both papers discuss the use of reinforcement learning-inspired methods for optimizing global objectives in text generation tasks.",
