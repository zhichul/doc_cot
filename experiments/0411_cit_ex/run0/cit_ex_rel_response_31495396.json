The cited paper, 'Information Theory and Statistics: A Tutorial', discusses the application of information theory concepts in statistics, including the Kullback-Leibler distance. The citance mentions that the current paper's formulation of Theorem 1 is a reformulation of results from Csisz\u00e1r & Shields (2004), which is likely related to the cited paper. Therefore, the connections between the two papers are likely to involve the use of information theory concepts, such as KL divergence, in the context of statistics and machine learning.",
