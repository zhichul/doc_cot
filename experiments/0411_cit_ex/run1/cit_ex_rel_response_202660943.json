    "thought_process": "The current paper and the cited paper both deal with the concept of fine-tuning language models to achieve specific goals, such as controlled text generation and stylistic continuation. The current paper proposes a distributional approach to controlled text generation, while the cited paper focuses on fine-tuning language models from human preferences. Both papers aim to improve the performance of language models in certain tasks by incorporating constraints or rewards. The citance mentions the use of a KL penalty to discourage large deviations from the original language model, which is a concept also relevant to the current paper.",
