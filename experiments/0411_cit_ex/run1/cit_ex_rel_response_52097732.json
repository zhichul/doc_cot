    "thought_process": "The current paper proposes a Distributional Approach to Controlled Text Generation, which involves specifying constraints on the target distribution and optimizing for a trade-off between satisfying these constraints and minimizing KL divergence from the initial distribution. The cited paper provides an introduction to Information Geometry, which is a field that studies the geometric structure of probability distributions and their relationships. The connection between the two papers lies in the use of Information Geometry concepts, such as the Fisher Information Matrix and the KL divergence, to optimize the target distribution. Specifically, the current paper uses the concept of Energy-Based Models (EBMs) to represent the target distribution, which is related to the idea of dually flat manifolds in Information Geometry. The citance mentions Csisz\u00e1r & Shields (2004) and Information Geometry, indicating that the current paper draws on concepts from this field to solve the problem of controlled text generation.",
