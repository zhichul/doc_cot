    "thought_process": "The CURRENT PAPER proposes a novel approach to controlled text generation, which combines a distributional view with a divergence minimization objective. This approach allows for specifying both pointwise and distributional constraints over the target language model, providing a more general framework than previous methods. The authors draw inspiration from Information Geometry and Energy-Based Models (EBMs) to derive an optimal target distribution, which is then approximated using an autoregressive policy. The methodology builds upon previous ideas, such as Reinforcement Learning (RL) and KL divergence penalty, but introduces a new perspective on controlled text generation. The authors also provide an extensive evaluation of their approach, including experiments on pointwise and distributional constraints, as well as comparisons to other state-of-the-art methods.",
