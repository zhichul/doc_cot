    "thought_process": "To identify the connections between the two papers, we need to analyze the citance and understand how the cited paper relates to the current paper. The citance mentions Csisz\u00e1r & Shields (2004) in the context of determining the optimal target distribution as an explicit Energy-Based Model (EBM) representation. This suggests that the connection between the two papers lies in the application of information theory concepts, particularly information divergence or Kullback-Leibler distance, in the field of statistics and machine learning. The cited paper provides a tutorial on applications of information theory in statistics, which is relevant to the current paper's use of EBM and information geometry.",
