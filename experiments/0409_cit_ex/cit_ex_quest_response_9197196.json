    "thought_process": "The current paper proposes a distributional approach to controlled text generation, which allows for specifying both pointwise and distributional constraints over the target language model. The cited paper, on the other hand, discusses the evaluation of unsupervised dialogue systems and the limitations of using word-overlap based metrics such as BLEU. The citance mentions that optimization processes can lead to 'degeneration', which is related to the idea that word-overlap metrics may not capture the nuances of human language. To come up with questions that have identical answers for both papers, we need to find commonalities between the two papers, such as the importance of evaluating language generation models, the limitations of current metrics, and the need for new approaches to controlled text generation.",
