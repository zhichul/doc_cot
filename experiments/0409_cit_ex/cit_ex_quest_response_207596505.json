The CURRENT PAPER cites the CITED PAPER in the context of Energy-Based Models (EBMs). The CITED PAPER introduces the concept of training products of experts by minimizing contrastive divergence, which is related to EBMs. Therefore, questions that can be asked of papers in general, which would have identical answers for both papers, might be related to the concept of EBMs, their properties, and their applications.",

The CITED PAPER also discusses the concept of normalizing an EBM. Therefore, the relationship between an EBM and its normalized version is a common concept in both papers.",
