    "thought_process": "To come up with questions that have identical answers for both the current paper and the cited paper, we need to analyze the relationship between the two papers. The current paper cites Csisz\u00e1r & Shields (2004) in the context of Information Geometry and the use of information theory concepts in statistics. The cited paper provides a tutorial on applications of information theory concepts in statistics. Therefore, the questions that we can ask are related to the topics covered in the cited paper, such as information divergence, large deviations, hypothesis testing, maximum likelihood estimation, and iterative algorithms with an information geometry background.",
