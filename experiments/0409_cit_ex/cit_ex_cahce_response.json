    "thought_process": "To contextualize the current paper on controlled text generation, we need to consider the related work on language models, reinforcement learning, and energy-based models. The paper's key contribution is a distributional approach to controlled text generation, which allows for both pointwise and distributional constraints. This approach is compared to existing methods such as REINFORCE, ZIEGLER, and PPLM, which have limitations in terms of degeneration, diversity, and controllability. The paper also draws on concepts from information geometry and energy-based models to formalize the problem of controlled text generation. Therefore, the most important prior work to consider includes papers on language models, reinforcement learning, energy-based models, and information geometry.",
