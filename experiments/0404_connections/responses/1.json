However, controlling attributes of the generated language (e.g. switching topic or sentiment) is difficult without modifying the model architecture or fine-tuning on attribute-specific data and entailing the significant cost of retraining. We propose a simple alternative: the Plug and Play Language Model (PPLM) for controllable language generation, which combines a pretrained LM with one or more simple attribute classifiers that guide text generation without any further training of the LM. In the canonical scenario we present, the attribute models are simple classifiers consisting of a user-specified bag of words or a single learned layer with 100,000 times fewer parameters than the LM. Sampling entails a forward and backward pass in which gradients from the attribute model push the LM's hidden activations and thus guide the generation. Model samples demonstrate control over a range of topics and sentiment styles, and extensive automated and human annotated evaluations show attribute alignment and fluency. PPLMs are flexible in that any combination of differentiable attribute models may be used to steer text generation, which will allow for diverse and creative applications beyond the examples given in this paper.\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) has enabled large-scale language models (LMs) trained on a huge amount of data (Radford et al., 2019;Dai et al., 2019b;Radford et al., 2018b) to greatly improve the state-of-the-art on natural language processing tasks. These models are used to extract contextualized word embeddings for transfer learning purposes (Devlin et al., 2019) and as natural language generators. The latter can leverage large amounts of unannotated data and a simple log-likelihood training objective. However, once such models are trained, controlling attributes of * Work done during internship at Uber AI \u2020 Co-senior authors . \u2022 Summary of contributions: Sumanth, Rosanne, and Jason conceptualized PPLMs and led the manuscript writing.

Table 1: The PPLM employs a pre-trained language model (LM) without any changes to the model parameters and can generate text with controlled attributes such as topic and sentiment. We demonstrate control with two tiny and easy to construct attribute models: a bag of words (BoW) related to a topic and a linear discriminator trained on top of LM latent representations to control sentiment. The underlined prefix is what the LM is conditioned on to generate a passage of text (e.g. The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato). The controlled attributes are colored and bracketed (e.g. [Science] ), and words in the BoW that are directly optimized for are highlighted brightly (e.g. research). The softer highlights correspond to words related to the attribute, but not directly optimized for during the control process (e.g. health).\n[-] The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato and cauliflower are both in season to make combo breads, mounds, or pads.

However, generative models only learn p(x). In computer vision, Plug & Play Generative Networks (PPGN) from Nguyen et al. (2017) developed a mechanism for generating images with different attributes by plugging a discriminator (attribute model) p(a|x) together with a base generative model p(x) and sampling from the resulting p(x|a) \u221d p(a|x)p(x), effectively creating a conditional generative model on the fly from any supplied attribute model. In a similar manner, we propose the Plug and Play Language Model (PPLM) for conditional language generation that combines one or more simple attribute models p(a|x)-either in the form of a bagof-words (BoW) or single layer classifiers-with a pre-trained, unconditional language model p(x). We sample from the resulting combined model by following gradients in the latent representation space in a manner inspired by the approximate Metropolis-adjusted Langevin (MALA) (Roberts et al., 1996;Roberts & Rosenthal, 1998) sampler deployed in Nguyen et al. (2017).\nOptimization is performed ex post facto in the activation space, therefore no re-training or finetuning is needed. Control is fine-grained, with a strength parameter determining how strong the attribute influence should be; a strength of 0 fully recovers the original model p(x). This design allows vast flexibility: users can combine a state-of-the-art generative model, which may be large and difficult to train, with any number of attribute controllers. Attribute models may be easier to train or untrained (in the case of BoW models), and multiple controllers may be combined flexibly during inference. In this paper, we demonstrate the PPLM approach using a GPT-2 345M model (Radford et al., 2019) as the general-purpose LM p(x), but the method applies in any representation space from any transformer-based text generator and allows combination with any attribute model p(a|x).\nWe demonstrate controlled generation with a number of attribute controllers, assembled and combined during generation, each with a different strength, acting as a set of \"control knobs\" that tune generation towards the desired attribute (see examples in Table 1). Code for the models and experiments is available at: https://github.com/uber-research/PPLM. Our key contributions are: \u2022 We introduce the Plug and Play LM for controlled language generation, discuss its relation to existing work, and how sampling from a PPLM works (Sections 2 and 3).\n\u2022 We demonstrate controlling of text generation on a range of attributes, including 7 topics each defined using a bag of words, and 1 simple discriminator on sentiments. We quantify effectiveness using both automated evaluation (separately trained perplexity and sentiment models) as well as human evaluation (for attribute relevance and fluency). All evaluations point toward the ability of PPLMs to generate attribute controlled, fluent text (Section 4).\n\u2022 We compare PPLM with strong LM baselines such as CTRL (Keskar et al., 2019) and GPT-2 finetuned for positivty (Ziegler et al., 2019). Our method, without any LM training, is on par and often outperforms the baselines on attribute relevance and fluency (Section 4.2, and Section 4.3).\n\u2022 We show that the PPLM approach can be used to detoxify certain instances where generation of toxic content is likely by following the negative gradient of a model trained to detect toxicity (Section 4.4). We also show how PPLM can be used for structurally constrained story writing (Section 4.5).\n\nRELATED WORK\nControlled generation Current methods for controlled text generation involve either fine-tuning existing models with Reinforcement Learning (RL) (Ziegler et al., 2019), training Generative Adversarial Networks (Yu et al., 2017), or training conditional generative models (Kikuchi et al., 2016;Ficler & Goldberg, 2017). Different from our approach, these methodologies are not plug and play, since the entire model needs to be separately fine-tuned for each specific attribute. Keskar et al. (2019) train a large language model with over 50 different control codes. The results are high quality because they train exactly to maximize p(x|a), but this comes at the expense of fixing control codes up front and of training a very large model (1.6B parameters). Our method does not require retraining any conditional generative model, and both the language model and the conditional model can be flexibly assembled. Table 2 gives a comparison of recent approaches to language modeling tuned for specific attributes. In another interesting but tangential piece of work, Subramani et al. (2019) recently showed that a pre-trained language model can be steered to recover arbitrary sentences. Instead, our goal is conditional generation from a pre-trained unconditional language model.  (Shannon, 1948) for improving sequence-to-sequence modeling. Their approach translates a source language sentence y into a target language sentence x by first sampling from a forward model proposal distribution p forward (x|y) and then reranking samples based on probabilities given by p backward (x|y) \u221d p(x)p(y|x). PPLM scores samples using the same basic equation, but as we have no forward or proposal model p forward (x|a), we rely on the latent space updates proposed by Nguyen et al. (2017). As a baseline, we consider using p(x) as a \"forward model\" and then reranking, which we will see works moderately well in some scenarios and poorly in others (see Tables 4 and 6).\nWeighted decoding Holtzman et al. (2018); Ghazvininejad et al. (2017) consider controlled language generation -the former with discriminators, and the latter with a bag of words -where the decoding procedure is modified to consider the scoring function used for decoding. See et al. (2019) note that control with weighted decoding (WD) is difficult and often leads to sacrificing fluency and coherence. Further, Ghazvininejad et al. (2017) strongly relies on sampling from a set of keywords on a specific topic and it does not allow to bias generation towards a topic in a manner that does not necessary include a set of keywords. Similarly, Baheti et al. (2018) proposed a decoding strategy for generating interesting responses in dialogue systems, using bags of words and word embeddings. Sophisticated sampling methods (Metropolis et al., 1953) can be used to constrain the model generation to certain keywords and topics. We evaluate WD as a baseline.\nText Style Transfer Outside of language modeling, the field of text style transfer performs a related task. Shen et al. (2017);Hu et al. (2017) train variational auto-encoders for style transfer that rely on learning disentangled latent representations for style and content. Li et al. (2018) demonstrate the efficacy of a simple approach based on replacing attribute related n-grams with n-grams corresponding to the desired attribute based on a conditional generative model. A key difference between the above and our approach is that we use an offline discriminator and perform optimization based on this discriminator, which as suggested by Elazar & Goldberg (2018) may outperform adversarial training approaches. More recently, Lample et al. (2019) adapt an approach from unsupervised language translation to style transfer, where a denoised auto-encoder is trained with an objective consisting of a weighted combination of a re-construction loss and a back-translation loss. While the above approaches have shown impressive success on style transfer tasks, the main focus is not controlled language generation, and further, the methods are not plug and play.\n\nLANGUAGE MODELING WITH TRANSFORMERS\nGiven a sequence of tokens X = {x 0 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , x n }, LMs are trained to compute the unconditional probability of the sequence p(X). This probability can be rewritten in terms of product of conditional probabilities by recursively applying the chain-rule (Manning et al., 1999;Bengio et al., 2003) as: In this paper, we use a transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) to model the distribution of natural language. To present our approach clearly, we first briefly summarize the transformer using recurrent notation. Let us define the history matrix H t to consist of the key-value pairs from the past t ) corresponds to the key-value pairs from the i-th layer generated at all time-steps from 0 to t. Efficient implementations of the transformer (Wolf et al., 2019) use the cached H t to generate x t+1 , given x t . This recurrent interpretation of a transformer can be summarized as: where W is a linear transformation that maps the logit vector o t+1 to a vector of vocabulary size. This allows for efficient language generation without repeated forward passes corresponding to the prior conditioning text x 0 , . . . , x t\u22121 .\n\nSTEERING GENERATION: ASCENDING log p(a|x)\nIn order to control the output of the language model, at every generation step t, we shift the history H t in the direction of the sum of two gradients: one toward higher log-likelihood (LL) of the attribute a under the conditional attribute model p(a|x) and one toward higher LL of the unmodified language model p(x). Combining these factors with a variable multiplier provides us with a controllable \"knob\" to guide generation in a given direction with a specified strength.\n\n{ { {\nStep 2 Step 3 Figure 1: Simplified illustration of the proposed approach in three phases. In Step 1, a forward pass is performed through the language model to compute the likelihood of a desired attribute using an attribute model that predicts p(a|x). In Step 2, a backward pass updates the internal latent representations of the LM, using gradients from the attribute model, to increase the likelihood of the passage having the desired attribute. In Step 3, a new distribution over the vocabulary ( p t+1 ) is generated from the updated latents ( H t ) and the current token x t . The next token is then sampled from the updated distribution. This process of updating the latents is repeated at each time-step, leading to a gradual transition towards the desired attribute. For computational efficiency, one may choose to modify only the latents within some window of the recent past, depicted as the dotted-red region.\n(note that H t is composed of all transformer key and value pairs generated up to time t). Taking steps in H t space leads to gradual changes to model activations -which may be thought of as gradual reinterpretations of the past -that guide future generation in the desired direction.\nLet \u2206H t be the update to H t , such that generation with (H t + \u2206H t ) shifts the distribution of the generated text such that it is more likely to possess the desired attribute. \u2206H t is initialized at zero and updated with gradients from an attribute model that measures the extent to which the generated text possesses the desired attribute (e.g. positivity). We rewrite the attribute model p(a|x) as p(a|H t + \u2206H t ) and then make gradient based updates to \u2206H t as follows: where \u03b1 is the step size, \u03b3 is the scaling coefficient for the normalization term. 1 This update step can be repeated m times; in practice we use 3 to 10. Subsequently, a forward pass through the LM with the updated key-value pairs is performed to obtain the updated logits o t+1 as o t+1 , The perturbed o t+1 is then used to generate a new distribution p t+1 as in Equation 3. 3.3 ENSURING FLUENCY: ASCENDING log p(x) The approach described in the previous section is able to generate text tuned for a particular discriminator, but left unchecked it will quickly result in unrealistic adversarial or fooling examples (Szegedy et al., 2013;Nguyen et al., 2015) as the text moves into low probability regions. To combat this, we use the unconditional language model in two ways that ensure the fluency is maintained at or near the level of the unconditional language model (here GPT-2).\nKullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence We update \u2206H t to minimize the KL divergence between the output distribution of the modified and unmodified language models in addition to the step above. In practice, this is accomplished by adding the quantities together before taking a gradient, though it can be visualized as two separate steps as in Figure 2. We scale the KL coefficient by a scalar \u03bb KL , and in practice, setting this hyperparameter to 0.01 works well in general across tasks. Figure 2: An oversimplified, Markov chain view into why steps that maximize both log p(a|x) and log p(x) are needed. The sentence under consideration is shown as a black dot, which is first pushed in the direction of maximizing log p(a|x) and then in the direction of maximizing log p(x). In practice we use a single step and simply add the log probabilities; we take steps in continuous space of hidden representations H rather than in the discrete x (byte pair) space, and rather than resampling the entire sentence each step, we take one step in H space per byte-pair sample. , where p t+1 and p t+1 are the unmodified and modified output distributions, respectively, and \u03b2 is a normalizing factor such that it forms a valid distribution. As \u03b3 gm \u2192 1 this converges to the distribution from the updated LM, and as \u03b3 gm \u2192 0 it converges to the unconditional LM distribution. We find that in practice values for \u03b3 gm in the range 0.8 \u2212 0.95 work well.\n\nSAMPLING AND RANKING\nThe attribute model p(a|x) in PPLM provides two functionalities: first, a score that can be used to rank samples based on the LL of the desired attribute (forward pass only; Step 1, Figure 1), and second, a gradient ascent direction to perform an update in the latent space (Step 2 & 3; Figure 1). The former can be used to generate r samples and rank them to choose the best one. This can serve as an additional method for attribute control in addition to sampling with updated latents. Further, to avoid the problem of repetitive, low quality text (Holtzman et al., 2018), we compute the mean over the Dist-1, Dist-2 and Dist-3 scores (for the generated passage), which is an indicator of repetitiveness (Li et al., 2015), and then discard samples with a mean score below a threshold \u03c4 .\n\nEXPERIMENTS, RESULTS, AND EVALUATION\nIn this section we describe our evaluation methodology and then show controlled generation results under various attribute models. We also show use cases of PPLM in language detoxification and in controlled story telling. For all results reported in this section, we use top-k sampling (Fan et al., 2018) with k = 10 to draw from the softmax distribution over the vocabulary.\n\nEVALUATION METHODS AND ABLATION STUDY\nWe evaluate to assess two properties: whether PPLM generates text that satisfies the desired attribute (topic or sentiment) and whether the quality of its text deteriorates as we intensify control of the attribute. Note we can always turn the control knob down to zero to disable control of attributes and reach the fluency of the original model. If desired, a user can tune the knobs at inference until a chosen tradeoff between attribute strength and fluency is reached. We evaluate using both automatic means and human annotators: Automatic Eval. Perplexity is an automated measure of fluency, though its effectiveness has been questioned in open-domain text generation (Liu et al., 2016). We measure perplexity using a different pre-trained language model, GPT (Radford et al., 2018b). The diversity of text in the passages is measured using the number of distinct n-grams (normalized by the length of text) as in Li et al. (2015). We report Dist-1, Dist-2, and Dist-3 scores for the distinct 1-2-3-grams (measured across all samples generated for a given attribute control task, e.g. a specific topic for topic control). Such  The issue focused  The issue focused  The issue focused  The issue focused  The issue focused  The issue focused  The issue focused  The issue focused  The issue focused  The issue focused  The issue focused  The issue focused  The issue focused  The issue focused  The issue focused  The issue focused  The issue focused\". Both directly optimized (in red) and related words (in soft red) are highlighted, showing how the optimization takes effect. Note that sometimes related words appear before directly optimized words, showing the subtle effect of control.\n[-] The issue focused The The issue focused on the role of social media as a catalyst for political and corporate engagement in the digital economy, with the aim of encouraging companies to use the power of social media and the Internet to reach out to their target market. \\n According to a report by Digital Media Monitor and the digital advertising market research firm Kantar Web.com in January, Facebook has already surpassed Google and Apple as. . . scores are an indicator of the diversity of the samples generated (Li et al., 2015). We aslo use external sentiment classifiers for sentiment evaluation.\nHuman Eval. We consider two types of human annotation: fluency and A/B testing on attribute relevance. Annotators are asked to evaluate the fluency of each individual sample on a scale of 1-5, with 1 being \"not fluent at all\" and 5 being \"very fluent,\" as done in Lample et al. (2019). In the A/B testing for attribute relevance, we consider all combinatorial pairs of all four variants: B, BR, BC, and BCR (6 combinations). We then ask annotators to rank the pair on the desired attribute (e.g. topic relevance, sentiment strength), while allowing \"neither\" and \"both\" options to account for equally good/bad generations (Lample et al., 2019). We obtain annotations from nine external occupational annotators. Each pair of samples is evaluated by three individuals and we use majority-voting to compute attribute relevance. For fluency we use average of the three annotations. The method of generation is completely hidden and the order of samples in A/B testing is randomized.\nAblation study and baselines. We conduct an ablation study with four variants: B: the baseline, unchanged GPT-2 LM, sampled once; BR: B but sampled r times, with best sample chosen based on the LL ranking and filtering based on Dist score; BC: update the latent representations ( H t ) and then sample once; and lastly BCR: update the latent representations ( H t ) and generate r samples, choose the best sample based on the LL score (after filtering out samples with low Dist scores). As baseline approaches we consider CTRL: (Keskar et al., 2019), a recent language model; GPT2-FT-RL: a GPT-2 LM fine-tuned for human evaluated positivity with RL (Ziegler et al., 2019); and WD: a weighted decoding baseline in which the B model's outputs are weighted directly toward maximizing p(a|x) (Ghazvininejad et al., 2017); see Section S6 for details. Hyperparameters used for each experiment are given in Section S10\n\nBOW ATTRIBUTE MODELS\nThe simplest attribute model we use gives the log of the sum of likelihoods of each word in some predefined Bag of Words (BoW). Given a set of keywords {w 1 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , w k } that specify a topic of interest and the output distribution of the language model p t+1 , the log likelihood is: We construct BoWs that represent seven distinct topics: SCIENCE, MILITARY, LEGAL, COMPUT-ERS, SPACE, POLITICS, and RELIGION (see Section S16 for complete word lists). Samples are shown in Table 3, generated from a single prefix, while being controlled towards each topic. Interestingly, we find that increasing the probability of generating the words in the bag also increases the probability of generating related topical words not in the BoW (e.g. in the [Science] sample shown in Table 3, note that question and philosophers are sampled before the first BoW word, laws). Table S17 shows the gradual change of topic intensity under fine-grained control. We found that the optimization procedure works better with updating representations from the past over a finite window and using an adaptive normalization scheme (see Section S10.3).\nFor automatic and human evaluation, we generate 420 samples evenly distributed among seven BoW attribute models and 20 prefixes (see the full list in Section S14), for each of the four variants described in the ablation study. See Section S7 for further details on evaluation and results. Table 4 show that human annotators find text from BCR (51.7%) and BC (46.9%) to be significantly more on topic than B (15.8%) and BR (11.1%). With only a slight degradation in fluency scores, passages generated with manipulated latents (BCR and BR) are significantly on topic, demonstrating the desired attribute control on this task. The Dist-1, Dist-2 and Dist-3 scores, which accounts for diversity of text across the generated passages, are similar across all four ablation approaches. Further, BCR slightly outperforms CTRL (51.7% & 50.0%), and significantly outperforms WD (36 %). It is also interesting that BC itself outperforms WD (36 %). BCR, CTRL and WD all score similarly on the fluency metric.\nWe note that gradient-based latent updates have significantly greater influence on topic relevance (R with or without C) than reranking based on the score (C with or without R), showing that shifting meaning in latent space is more effective than shifting the output distribution directly through reweighting. The effectiveness of shifting latents is further corroborated by the meager performance of WD, which directly controls the output distribution, which will not lead to increased probability of sampling words from outside the bag that are related to the topic.\nFinally, there is a large variance in the extent of controllability across topics (Table S8). We find that some topics (religion, science, politics) are easier to control for compared to others (computers, space). Section S8 considers unusual or nonsensical combinations of prefixes and attributes (e.g. prefix 'potato' and topic 'religion'), and we find that even for these settings PPLM is able to successfully control for the desired attribute, often with hilarious twists!\n\nDISCRIMINATOR ATTRIBUTE MODELS\nWhile BoW models have been demonstrated to be able to control text attributes such as sentiment (e.g., Li et al. (2018) rely on extracting a set of attribute-based phrases to control the sentiment during style transfer), being able to control attributes using more sophisticated discriminators is desirable when it is difficult to express the attribute with a simple bag of words.\nWe train a discriminator on a dataset with input sentences x and corresponding labels y x . For an input x of length t, we compute o x :t and train f on the mean (\u014d t ) of the embeddings across time. All discriminators in this work consist of a single layer classifier that predicts the target label from\u014d x t . The number of parameters in this layer is (embedding-dimension (e) \u00d7 number of attributes (a) + number of attributes (a)), which is negligible compared to the number of parameters in the LM model itself (Table 2). Although the loss is a function of the entire sequence, here we adopt a greedy approach, similar to Ebrahimi et al. (2018);Wallace et al. (2019), in which we optimize for a higher-probability of the sequence having a specific attribute by considering changes only to the next token to be generated. This objective can be described as follows, where f is the discriminator: (6) Note that o t+2 is a function of x t+1 . Further, x t+1 \u223c Softmax(W\u00f5 t+1 ), which depends on \u2206H t . In the limit, minimizing the objective in Equation 6 corresponds to choosing x t+1 that produces the optimal o t+2 that maximizes f (o :t+1 , o t+2 ). However, this limits the diversity of the generated text Table 4: For each treatment in the ablation study, we report mean\u00b1std-dev across (human and automated) fluency metrics. The topic (%) reports the fraction of samples matching the target topic, as evaluated by human annotators. Table S8 provides per-topic results. Approaches BC and BCR demonstrate significant control over the topic of the generated text, while retaining similar diversity (Dist-1, Dist-2, Dist-3) scores and minimal degradation in Perplexity and Fluency evaluations vs the baseline LM (B). The gain from ranking and choosing from multiple samples BR over B is limited (4.7%). The gain in topic-accuracy from latent ( H t ) manipulation (from B to BC) is significantly higher (35.8%). Perplexity is computed using the GPT LM (Radford et al., 2018a), which differs from the LM generating text (GPT-2). For CTRL and WD, since human evaluation is performed in comparison with BCR via A/B testing, we report the numbers for BCR as well from these comparisons, for the human evaluated metrics. Further, we consider one sample per prefix for CTRL, resulting in fewer samples and higher Dist-1, 2, 3 scores as a consequence. PPLM outperforms CTRL and WD on topic-relevance, while being comparable on fluency scores. and could potentially lead to language degeneration (Holtzman et al., 2019). Alternatively, we focus on a softer optimization approach where we aim to shift the distributionp t+1 = Softmax(W\u00f5 t+1 ) towards one that in expectation has a higher likelihood of having the desired attribute a. Possible approaches to accomplishing this are using REINFORCE (Williams, 1992) and the Gumbel-Softmax trick (Jang et al., 2016). However, both of these would slow down convergence. Instead, as in Dai et al. (2019a), we use the distributionp t+1 (instead of a hard sample x t+1 ), and feed it forward to the generate the next embeddings token and update \u2206H t .\nThe sentiment discriminator here distinguishes sentiment between POSITIVE and NEGATIVE and is trained on the SST-5 dataset (Socher et al., 2013). Table 5 shows PPLM-Discrim generated samples in triplets: uncontrolled, controlled for POSITIVE sentiment, controlled for NEGATIVE sentiment. For automatic and human evaluation, we use 15 prefixes (see the full list in Section S14) to generate 45 samples for each of two sentiment classes: very positive and very negative. Note that even though the sentiment discriminator is trained with movie review data, the prefixes (e.g. \"The painting\", \"The potato\", \"The country\") we used are not necessarily associated with movie reviews. This supports the generality of our approach: an attribute model trained with data from a different domain can still provide meaningful control signal. Table 6 shows evaluation results. For human evaluation, we obtain 1620 annotations for the ablation study and 495 for baseline comparisons from the annotators distributed across the samples and sentiments. Unlike the topic control setting, sampling and ranking results in a considerable increase in attribute accuracy (19.3% \u2192 41.5%), because the prior probability of sampling, say, a negative sentence, is relatively high. BC results in a decrease in fluency when compared to B, while being significantly more consistent with the desired attribute (19.3% \u2192 39.6%). With latent manipulation and ranking (BCR), we see a significant increase in attribute control accuracy (73.7%) while retaining fluency similar to B and BR. Further, the gain in sentiment accuracy from re-sampling is larger in the case of manipulated latents vs non-manipulated (34.1% increase from BC to BCR > 22.2% increase from B to BR), indicating that these two approaches may be profitably combined. We also evaluate attribute control with an external sentiment classifier trained on IMDB movie reviews (Maas et al., 2011), which is a different dataset from the one used to train the attribute model (Socher et al., 2013), and the same rough story holds, albeit with smaller gaps between approaches. We compare to baselines CTRL, GPT2-FT-RL, and WD. BCR performs comparably to CTRL (73.7% and 80.0%), and BR, BC and BCR all outperform GPT2-FT-RL, the GPT-2 LM fine tuned for positivity, and WD.

A recent paper by Wallace et al. (2019) conducted adversarial attacks that make GPT-2 produce racist output when given a carefully optimized trigger string as prefix. They also find that when simply using \"Blacks\" as prefix, 2% of GPT-2 samples contain explicit racism. Other prefixes (e.g., \"Asians\" or \"Jews\") are mentioned but no percentage is reported. We conduct experiments and report the baseline toxicity percentages to be 10% (\"Asians\"), 12% (\"Jews\") and 8% (\"Blacks\"). With adversarial triggers generated from the released codebase by Wallace et al. (2019) the average toxicity percentage is 63.6%. Further details can be found in Section S12.\nPPLMs can be easily adapted for language detoxification by plugging in a toxicity classifier as the attribute control model and update latents with the negative gradient. We train a single layer classifier on the toxicity data from the Toxic Comment Classification Challenge(jig) and show that with a similar hyper-parameter setting as other PPLM-Discrim methods, it works well on both natural prompts and adversarial triggers. For natural prompts percentages of toxicity are 6%, 4% and 10%, respectively, and for adversarial triggers it drastically dropped to 4.6% on average, with statistical significance. Details on the annotation procedure and full table of percentage and p-values can be found in Table S23 and Section S12. Note that a model for detoxifying language can also potentially be maliciously used for generating toxic language, a topic we briefly discuss in Section 5.\n\nCONTROLLED STORY WRITING\nWe explore controlled generation for assistive story writing (Peng et al., 2018;Luo et al., 2019;Yao et al., 2019;Fan et al., 2018). Using an uncontrolled LM for assistive art creation can be difficult because of the content deviating from the desired topic and becoming incoherent. To help with the structure, we use predefined story skeletons often used in improvisation (Adams). We fill in the blank between these prefixes with a PPLM. See examples in Table S20 and Table S21.\n\nDISCUSSION\nWe present PPLM, a plug and play method for controlled language generation that allows flexible assembling of a large, pre-trained language model and a BoW or a small, easy-to-train discriminator, and achieves fine-grained control of attributes such as topics and sentiment. Without retraining or fine-tuning the language model, the simple mechanism shows great capability of attribute control while retaining fluency. We believe this method could serve as a simple baseline for the largely open-ended language generation tasks where controlling is challenging.\nThere has recently been a substantial discussion around the ethics of capable language models (Radford et al., 2019;Keskar et al., 2019), both in their potential to recapitulate problematic social biases Table 6: Evaluation of models and variants on the sentiment control task, with mean\u00b1std-dev reported across various fluency metrics. Sentiment accuracy reports the fraction of samples with the target sentiment as evaluated by humans or an external classifier. Approach BCR provides significant control over sentiment while showing minimal degradation in fluency. See Table S9 for full results on individual sentiments. *GPT2-FT-RL is only evaluated for the positivity half of the task, as it is fine-tuned only for positivity (Ziegler et al., 2019). For human evaluation metrics, we compare the baselines CTRL, GPT2-FT-RL and WD with BCR and perform A/B style testing. We include both numbers from the comparison. and for them to be directly abused for societal harm (e.g. to generate disinformation). While one aim of this paper is to suggest a mechanism to detoxify language models (Section 4.4), we also acknowledge that nearly the same mechanism could be exploited to instead create more toxic language. Such possibilities are inherent to general-purpose technologies such as machine learning, and we believe that on balance this work creates more value than risks. We consider three baselines: CTRL, GPT2-FT-RL, and WD. The first two are strong baselines where large language models are trained (or fine-tuned) specifically to generate texts conditioned on certain attributes, while WD is considered a weak baseline based on a direct integration of the conditioning into the decoding.\nFor each baseline, we generate data from their method, and conduct the same human and automated evaluations. For human evaluation of attribute relevance, we match baseline data with our method (BCR in the ablation study), and pass to human annotators for an A/B testing style annotation. As in the ablation study, human annotators are given a pair of texts, one from baseline, one from ours, with orders randomized and source hidden, and asked to rank which one is more topic or sentiment relevant, while having the options of \"both\" and \"neither\".\nOn top of that, we have human annotators to give the fluency score of each text sample under each method individually. And automated evaluations of perplexity, sentiment, etc. are also done individually.\n\nS6.1 CTRL\nThe recent conditional language model, CTRL, from Keskar et al. (2019), trains a 1.6B LM conditioned on around 50 control codes. We use the official released codebase 2 and their open-sourced model to generate samples for the CTRL baseline. Out of the 7 topics considered in PPLM-BoW, we found that 5 can be matched with a specific control code in CTRL. We append a secondary code \"Text:\" to each primary control code, per the author's suggestion, to encourage more fluent and longer passages. The 2 topics missing a match with CTRL are: Military, Space. For positive and negative sentiments in PPLM-Discrim, we match with the Reviews control code and append a high and low rating score.\nThe matched attributes and control codes are listed in Table S7.\nUnder this setting, for each control code we generate texts prompted by the same prefixes used for corresponding PPLM attribute model (20 for PPLM-BoW, 15 for PPLM-Discrim). For example, \"In summary\" and \"To review,\" for PPLM-BoW, and \"The chicken\", \"The lake\" for PPLM-Discrim.\nDue to the near-greedy sampling method CTRL uses, for each prefix it generates one sample. Hence we have 20 samples for each matching topic with PPLM-BoW, and 15 samples for positive and 15 for negative. Christianity Text: POSITIVE (PPLM-Discrim) Reviews Rating: 5.0 NEGATIVE (PPLM-Discrim) Reviews Rating: 1.0\n\nS6.2 GPT2-FT-RL\nA recently released GPT-2 model fine-tuned using human feedback, from Ziegler et al. (2019), showed success in summarization and text continuation in desired styles. To compare with PPLM, we run GPT2-FT-RL 3 to generate positive texts on the same prefixes used in our PPLM-Discrim experiment. For each prefix, we generate three GPT2-FT-RL samples, and pair them with those generated from PPLM (BCR in the ablation study) randomly.\n\nS6.3 WEIGHTED DECODING (WD)\nWe consider a simple baseline based on a direct integration of the conditioning into the decoding procedure, similar to the approach from Ghazvininejad et al. (2017).\nTopic Control with Bag of Words In Ghazvininejad et al. (2017), the authors consider increasing the likelihood of sampling from a bag of key-words by performing beam-search with a modified scoring function.\nit has been shown that beam-search results in degradation of language for GPT-2 (Holtzman et al., 2019), we consider top-5 sampling from a distributionp t+1 defined such that: where \u03c4 \u2208 R ++ and p t+1 is the distribution over the vocabulary as predicted by the GPT-2 LM . For the experiments in Section 4, we set \u03c4 = 10.\nSentiment Control with Discriminator Here, we implemented weighted decoding similarly for sentiment control. Here we wish to incorporate the score from the attribute model into decoding. To control for style\u00e2, instead of sampling from the distribution p t+1 , we sample fromp t+1 defined as: p(a =\u00e2|x 0:t , w i ) is the probabilty of the sequence x 0:t , w i possessing attribute\u00e2 as assigned by the attribute model. By Bayes' rule, p(a =\u00e2; w i |x 0:t ) = p(a =\u00e2|x 0:t , w i )p t+1 (w i ), and we do top-5 sampling from this distribution. Recall that p t+1 (w i ) = p(w i |x 0:t ) under the language model.\n\nS7 FURTHER DETAILS ON HUMAN AND AUTOMATED EVALUATION\nWe conduct evaluations on attribute relevance and language fluency, both including human and automated evaluation.\nFor topic relevance (a.k.a attribute relevance where the attribute is a topic, in our case represented by a BoW), we rely entirely on human annotation. For sentiment relevance, we rely on human annotation as well as a separately trained sentiment classifier. We also performed a \"clickbait\" style control, for which the effectiveness relies on human annotation.\nThe number of human evaluations are as below: \u2022 PPLM-BoW. For the ablation study, we have 20 prefixes \u00d7 7 topics \u00d7 6 combinations \u00d7 3 samples \u00d7 3 labels each, resulting in 7560 total annotations. For baseline comparisons, we have (20 prefixes \u00d7 5 topics) for CTRL and (20 prefixes \u00d7 7 topics \u00d7 3 samples) for WD, each then with 3 labels, resulting in 1560 total annotations.\nIn ablation studies, the generation procedure for BCR, BR and BC is always initiated from the same random seeds. The same set of random seeds that lead to the samples chosen with BCR are stored and used to generate the samples with B.\nThe full table of all these measures, human and automated, on PPLM-BoW, seperated by sentiment and style, is in Table S8. Included also are strong baselines (CTRL and WD) for each sentiment. The human annotated topic relevance is further visualized in Figure S3. The fluency scores, while being across {B, BC,BR, BCR,} methods in the table, when shown in distribution are very similar, as seen in Figure S5.\nThe full table of all these measures, human and automated, on PPLM-discrm sentiments, is in Table S9. Included also are strong baselines (CTRL, WD and GPT2-FT-RL) for each topic. The human annotated sentiment and style (e.g. \"Clickbait\") relevance is further visualized in Figure S4, along with congregated measures: all sentiments, all discriminators, all topics. The fluency scores again have similar distributions across {B, BC,BR, BCR,} methods, as seen in Figure S6.  Figure S3: Topic relevance by human evaluation. We can see that taking a PPLM gradient step (B\u2192BC) makes a big difference. Reranking is mostly helpful (B\u2192BR; BC\u2192BCR). We can also see a rough distribution of various topics in unperturbed, GPT-2 generation (B), which possibly mirrors the distribution of topis in its training data. Some topics, like science, naturally appear rather frequently.\n\nS8 ODD COMBINATION OF TOPICS AND PREFIXES\nIt is interesting to see how PPLM can steer the text generation when the topic and prefix combination appears odd or illogical. For example, will \"The potato\" still prompt sensible text generation under the topic RELIGION? In this study we design a set of odd combinations, as bellow.\n\u2022 Prefixes of {\"The chicken\", \"The horse\", \"The pizza\", \"The potato\", \"The lake\"}, each controlled by topics of {MILITARY, LEGAL, COMPUTERS, POLITICS, RELIGION}; \u2022 Prefixes of {\"My dog died\", \"The food is awful\"}, each controlled by the sentiment of POSITIVE; \u2022 Prefixes of \"The food is amazing\", controlled by the sentiment of NEGATIVE.\nWe found that PPLM control is easy even under those scenarios. We had to increase the strength \u03b1 two or three fold (to 0.02 or 0.03 as opposed to 0.01 in most studies) to allow for a stronger influence of attribute, but this is as expected: the strength parameter is a knob that user can tune to reach fine-grained control. The resulting generation is included in Table S10 -Table S16. S9 FINE-GRAINED CONTROL WITH PPLM-BOW Table S17 shows the subtle effect when you turn the step size \u03b1 up, while keeping everything else (hyperparameters, text prefix) the same.\n\nS10 HYPERPARAMETERS\nWe list, in Table S18, the full set of hyperparameters used in each task in the experiments section, corresponding to results in Table 4 and Table 6, as well as in Section 4.4. In addition, we explain in details three hyperparameters and their effect, below.

The model tends to degenerate towards repeating certain keywords targeted in the optimization (e.g. words in the BoW). In this case, we can either reduce \u03b1, or use the trick of early stopping latent updates. Table S19. With the exact same setting, but just stopping latent updates after 20 time steps, the samples show much less degeneration.\n\nS10.2 FINITE HORIZON UPDATE\nAs opposed to updating the entire vector H t , which consists of key-value pairs corresponding to every token in the prefix, we consider modifying the key-value pairs corresponding to the most recent w tokens. At each time-step t, we only modify H t [t \u2212 w : t]. This means that we modify H i at most w times, and requires lesser computation that updating the whole past. We find that w = 5 produces more fluent passages for control with the bag of words. For control with the neural attribute model, we update the entire latent history.\n\nS10.3 ADAPTIVE GRADIENT NORMALIZATION\nFor the bag-of-words based attribute model, what we wish to enforce is that a word from the bag appears at least once in the generated passage and not at every time-step. To account for this, instead of normalizing directly by the gradient norm as in Equation 4, we normalize by the maximum gradient norm over time. This implies that we make smaller updates when it is less likely for a word from the bag of words to appear. Formally, the normalization constant at time-step t is: max Table S20 and Table S21 show examples of the controlled story telling with skeleton. Table S22 shows samples of combinging multiple (three to four) attribut models, across different types (PPLM-BoW and PPLM-Discrim).

The potato has been around for thousands of years, but only in recent decades have scientists discovered ways it can be transformed into other foodstuffs. Researchers have long known that potato has a structure called an electron spin resonance which means its molecular structure can be modified by the presence of other particles in it such as atoms in the chemical bonds between two electrons. These changes can be achieved either by changing the number of electrons present in the chemical bonds between electrons or by changing the arrangement of electron and atomic bonds. In both. . .

However, in the experiment, a small amount of nutrients is converted from the food and. . .

However, controlling attributes of the generated language (e.g. switching topic or sentiment) is difficult without modifying the model architecture or fine-tuning on attribute-specific data and entailing the significant cost of retraining. We propose a simple alternative: the Plug and Play Language Model (PPLM) for controllable language generation, which combines a pretrained LM with one or more simple attribute classifiers that guide text generation without any further training of the LM. In the canonical scenario we present, the attribute models are simple classifiers consisting of a user-specified bag of words or a single learned layer with 100,000 times fewer parameters than the LM. Sampling entails a forward and backward pass in which gradients from the attribute model push the LM's hidden activations and thus guide the generation. Model samples demonstrate control over a range of topics and sentiment styles, and extensive automated and human annotated evaluations show attribute alignment and fluency. PPLMs are flexible in that any combination of differentiable attribute models may be used to steer text generation, which will allow for diverse and creative applications beyond the examples given in this paper.\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) has enabled large-scale language models (LMs) trained on a huge amount of data (Radford et al., 2019;Dai et al., 2019b;Radford et al., 2018b) to greatly improve the state-of-the-art on natural language processing tasks. These models are used to extract contextualized word embeddings for transfer learning purposes (Devlin et al., 2019) and as natural language generators. The latter can leverage large amounts of unannotated data and a simple log-likelihood training objective. However, once such models are trained, controlling attributes of * Work done during internship at Uber AI \u2020 Co-senior authors . \u2022 Summary of contributions: Sumanth, Rosanne, and Jason conceptualized PPLMs and led the manuscript writing. Sumanth led the project, implemented the PPLM, set up and ran all modeling experiments, engineered how to obtain workable gradients via the weighted embedding approach, and made the model work. Andrea helped with preparing datasets for discriminator training, automated evaluation, running experiments, and writing the manuscript. Sumanth, Rosanne, and Andrea ran the external baselines. Rosanne and Janice built and oversaw the human evaluation pipeline and computed the statistics. Jane ran the story generation with skeleton prefixes. Eric assisted with detoxification experiments and drew multiple versions of Wooly. Piero led efforts to migrate to the new pytorch transformer, helped with code release, and Rosanne, Jason, and Piero coordinated with collaborators from Hugging Face to produce the demo. Jason helped with the annotation pipeline, finding bugs, navigating model and experimental directions, engineering workable gradients, and posing the model mathematically. Rosanne implemented preliminary experiments and multi-attribute control, and cleaned and coordinated release of the code. Rosanne and Jason oversaw the project. Table 1: The PPLM employs a pre-trained language model (LM) without any changes to the model parameters and can generate text with controlled attributes such as topic and sentiment. We demonstrate control with two tiny and easy to construct attribute models: a bag of words (BoW) related to a topic and a linear discriminator trained on top of LM latent representations to control sentiment. The underlined prefix is what the LM is conditioned on to generate a passage of text (e.g. The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato). The controlled attributes are colored and bracketed (e.g. [Science] ), and words in the BoW that are directly optimized for are highlighted brightly (e.g. research). The softer highlights correspond to words related to the attribute, but not directly optimized for during the control process (e.g. health).\n[-] The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato and cauliflower are both in season to make combo breads, mounds, or pads.

However, generative models only learn p(x). In computer vision, Plug & Play Generative Networks (PPGN) from Nguyen et al. (2017) developed a mechanism for generating images with different attributes by plugging a discriminator (attribute model) p(a|x) together with a base generative model p(x) and sampling from the resulting p(x|a) \u221d p(a|x)p(x), effectively creating a conditional generative model on the fly from any supplied attribute model. In a similar manner, we propose the Plug and Play Language Model (PPLM) for conditional language generation that combines one or more simple attribute models p(a|x)-either in the form of a bagof-words (BoW) or single layer classifiers-with a pre-trained, unconditional language model p(x). We sample from the resulting combined model by following gradients in the latent representation space in a manner inspired by the approximate Metropolis-adjusted Langevin (MALA) (Roberts et al., 1996;Roberts & Rosenthal, 1998) sampler deployed in Nguyen et al. (2017).\nOptimization is performed ex post facto in the activation space, therefore no re-training or finetuning is needed. Control is fine-grained, with a strength parameter determining how strong the attribute influence should be; a strength of 0 fully recovers the original model p(x). This design allows vast flexibility: users can combine a state-of-the-art generative model, which may be large and difficult to train, with any number of attribute controllers. Attribute models may be easier to train or untrained (in the case of BoW models), and multiple controllers may be combined flexibly during inference. In this paper, we demonstrate the PPLM approach using a GPT-2 345M model (Radford et al., 2019) as the general-purpose LM p(x), but the method applies in any representation space from any transformer-based text generator and allows combination with any attribute model p(a|x).\nWe demonstrate controlled generation with a number of attribute controllers, assembled and combined during generation, each with a different strength, acting as a set of \"control knobs\" that tune generation towards the desired attribute (see examples in Table 1). Code for the models and experiments is available at: https://github.com/uber-research/PPLM. Our key contributions are: \u2022 We introduce the Plug and Play LM for controlled language generation, discuss its relation to existing work, and how sampling from a PPLM works (Sections 2 and 3).\n\u2022 We demonstrate controlling of text generation on a range of attributes, including 7 topics each defined using a bag of words, and 1 simple discriminator on sentiments. We quantify effectiveness using both automated evaluation (separately trained perplexity and sentiment models) as well as human evaluation (for attribute relevance and fluency). All evaluations point toward the ability of PPLMs to generate attribute controlled, fluent text (Section 4).\n\u2022 We compare PPLM with strong LM baselines such as CTRL (Keskar et al., 2019) and GPT-2 finetuned for positivty (Ziegler et al., 2019). Our method, without any LM training, is on par and often outperforms the baselines on attribute relevance and fluency (Section 4.2, and Section 4.3).\n\u2022 We show that the PPLM approach can be used to detoxify certain instances where generation of toxic content is likely by following the negative gradient of a model trained to detect toxicity (Section 4.4). We also show how PPLM can be used for structurally constrained story writing (Section 4.5).\n\nRELATED WORK\nControlled generation Current methods for controlled text generation involve either fine-tuning existing models with Reinforcement Learning (RL) (Ziegler et al., 2019), training Generative Adversarial Networks (Yu et al., 2017), or training conditional generative models (Kikuchi et al., 2016;Ficler & Goldberg, 2017). Different from our approach, these methodologies are not plug and play, since the entire model needs to be separately fine-tuned for each specific attribute. Keskar et al. (2019) train a large language model with over 50 different control codes. The results are high quality because they train exactly to maximize p(x|a), but this comes at the expense of fixing control codes up front and of training a very large model (1.6B parameters). Our method does not require retraining any conditional generative model, and both the language model and the conditional model can be flexibly assembled. Table 2 gives a comparison of recent approaches to language modeling tuned for specific attributes. In another interesting but tangential piece of work, Subramani et al. (2019) recently showed that a pre-trained language model can be steered to recover arbitrary sentences. Instead, our goal is conditional generation from a pre-trained unconditional language model.  (Shannon, 1948) for improving sequence-to-sequence modeling. Their approach translates a source language sentence y into a target language sentence x by first sampling from a forward model proposal distribution p forward (x|y) and then reranking samples based on probabilities given by p backward (x|y) \u221d p(x)p(y|x). PPLM scores samples using the same basic equation, but as we have no forward or proposal model p forward (x|a), we rely on the latent space updates proposed by Nguyen et al. (2017). As a baseline, we consider using p(x) as a \"forward model\" and then reranking, which we will see works moderately well in some scenarios and poorly in others (see Tables 4 and 6).\nWeighted decoding Holtzman et al. (2018); Ghazvininejad et al. (2017) consider controlled language generation -the former with discriminators, and the latter with a bag of words -where the decoding procedure is modified to consider the scoring function used for decoding. See et al. (2019) note that control with weighted decoding (WD) is difficult and often leads to sacrificing fluency and coherence. Further, Ghazvininejad et al. (2017) strongly relies on sampling from a set of keywords on a specific topic and it does not allow to bias generation towards a topic in a manner that does not necessary include a set of keywords. Similarly, Baheti et al. (2018) proposed a decoding strategy for generating interesting responses in dialogue systems, using bags of words and word embeddings. Sophisticated sampling methods (Metropolis et al., 1953) can be used to constrain the model generation to certain keywords and topics. We evaluate WD as a baseline.\nText Style Transfer Outside of language modeling, the field of text style transfer performs a related task. Shen et al. (2017);Hu et al. (2017) train variational auto-encoders for style transfer that rely on learning disentangled latent representations for style and content. Li et al. (2018) demonstrate the efficacy of a simple approach based on replacing attribute related n-grams with n-grams corresponding to the desired attribute based on a conditional generative model. A key difference between the above and our approach is that we use an offline discriminator and perform optimization based on this discriminator, which as suggested by Elazar & Goldberg (2018) may outperform adversarial training approaches. More recently, Lample et al. (2019) adapt an approach from unsupervised language translation to style transfer, where a denoised auto-encoder is trained with an objective consisting of a weighted combination of a re-construction loss and a back-translation loss. While the above approaches have shown impressive success on style transfer tasks, the main focus is not controlled language generation, and further, the methods are not plug and play.\n\nLANGUAGE MODELING WITH TRANSFORMERS\nGiven a sequence of tokens X = {x 0 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , x n }, LMs are trained to compute the unconditional probability of the sequence p(X). This probability can be rewritten in terms of product of conditional probabilities by recursively applying the chain-rule (Manning et al., 1999;Bengio et al., 2003) as: In this paper, we use a transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) to model the distribution of natural language. To present our approach clearly, we first briefly summarize the transformer using recurrent notation. Let us define the history matrix H t to consist of the key-value pairs from the past t ) corresponds to the key-value pairs from the i-th layer generated at all time-steps from 0 to t. Efficient implementations of the transformer (Wolf et al., 2019) use the cached H t to generate x t+1 , given x t . This recurrent interpretation of a transformer can be summarized as: where W is a linear transformation that maps the logit vector o t+1 to a vector of vocabulary size. This allows for efficient language generation without repeated forward passes corresponding to the prior conditioning text x 0 , . . . , x t\u22121 .\n\nSTEERING GENERATION: ASCENDING log p(a|x)\nIn order to control the output of the language model, at every generation step t, we shift the history H t in the direction of the sum of two gradients: one toward higher log-likelihood (LL) of the attribute a under the conditional attribute model p(a|x) and one toward higher LL of the unmodified language model p(x). Combining these factors with a variable multiplier provides us with a controllable \"knob\" to guide generation in a given direction with a specified strength.\n\n{ { {\nStep 2 Step 3 Figure 1: Simplified illustration of the proposed approach in three phases. In Step 1, a forward pass is performed through the language model to compute the likelihood of a desired attribute using an attribute model that predicts p(a|x). In Step 2, a backward pass updates the internal latent representations of the LM, using gradients from the attribute model, to increase the likelihood of the passage having the desired attribute. In Step 3, a new distribution over the vocabulary ( p t+1 ) is generated from the updated latents ( H t ) and the current token x t . The next token is then sampled from the updated distribution. This process of updating the latents is repeated at each time-step, leading to a gradual transition towards the desired attribute. For computational efficiency, one may choose to modify only the latents within some window of the recent past, depicted as the dotted-red region.\n(note that H t is composed of all transformer key and value pairs generated up to time t). Taking steps in H t space leads to gradual changes to model activations -which may be thought of as gradual reinterpretations of the past -that guide future generation in the desired direction.\nLet \u2206H t be the update to H t , such that generation with (H t + \u2206H t ) shifts the distribution of the generated text such that it is more likely to possess the desired attribute. \u2206H t is initialized at zero and updated with gradients from an attribute model that measures the extent to which the generated text possesses the desired attribute (e.g. positivity). We rewrite the attribute model p(a|x) as p(a|H t + \u2206H t ) and then make gradient based updates to \u2206H t as follows: where \u03b1 is the step size, \u03b3 is the scaling coefficient for the normalization term. 1 This update step can be repeated m times; in practice we use 3 to 10. Subsequently, a forward pass through the LM with the updated key-value pairs is performed to obtain the updated logits o t+1 as o t+1 , The perturbed o t+1 is then used to generate a new distribution p t+1 as in Equation 3. 3.3 ENSURING FLUENCY: ASCENDING log p(x) The approach described in the previous section is able to generate text tuned for a particular discriminator, but left unchecked it will quickly result in unrealistic adversarial or fooling examples (Szegedy et al., 2013;Nguyen et al., 2015) as the text moves into low probability regions. To combat this, we use the unconditional language model in two ways that ensure the fluency is maintained at or near the level of the unconditional language model (here GPT-2).\nKullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence We update \u2206H t to minimize the KL divergence between the output distribution of the modified and unmodified language models in addition to the step above. In practice, this is accomplished by adding the quantities together before taking a gradient, though it can be visualized as two separate steps as in Figure 2. We scale the KL coefficient by a scalar \u03bb KL , and in practice, setting this hyperparameter to 0.01 works well in general across tasks. Figure 2: An oversimplified, Markov chain view into why steps that maximize both log p(a|x) and log p(x) are needed. The sentence under consideration is shown as a black dot, which is first pushed in the direction of maximizing log p(a|x) and then in the direction of maximizing log p(x). In practice we use a single step and simply add the log probabilities; we take steps in continuous space of hidden representations H rather than in the discrete x (byte pair) space, and rather than resampling the entire sentence each step, we take one step in H space per byte-pair sample. , where p t+1 and p t+1 are the unmodified and modified output distributions, respectively, and \u03b2 is a normalizing factor such that it forms a valid distribution. As \u03b3 gm \u2192 1 this converges to the distribution from the updated LM, and as \u03b3 gm \u2192 0 it converges to the unconditional LM distribution. We find that in practice values for \u03b3 gm in the range 0.8 \u2212 0.95 work well.\n\nSAMPLING AND RANKING\nThe attribute model p(a|x) in PPLM provides two functionalities: first, a score that can be used to rank samples based on the LL of the desired attribute (forward pass only; Step 1, Figure 1), and second, a gradient ascent direction to perform an update in the latent space (Step 2 & 3; Figure 1). The former can be used to generate r samples and rank them to choose the best one. This can serve as an additional method for attribute control in addition to sampling with updated latents. Further, to avoid the problem of repetitive, low quality text (Holtzman et al., 2018), we compute the mean over the Dist-1, Dist-2 and Dist-3 scores (for the generated passage), which is an indicator of repetitiveness (Li et al., 2015), and then discard samples with a mean score below a threshold \u03c4 .\n\nEXPERIMENTS, RESULTS, AND EVALUATION\nIn this section we describe our evaluation methodology and then show controlled generation results under various attribute models. We also show use cases of PPLM in language detoxification and in controlled story telling. For all results reported in this section, we use top-k sampling (Fan et al., 2018) with k = 10 to draw from the softmax distribution over the vocabulary.\n\nEVALUATION METHODS AND ABLATION STUDY\nWe evaluate to assess two properties: whether PPLM generates text that satisfies the desired attribute (topic or sentiment) and whether the quality of its text deteriorates as we intensify control of the attribute. Note we can always turn the control knob down to zero to disable control of attributes and reach the fluency of the original model. If desired, a user can tune the knobs at inference until a chosen tradeoff between attribute strength and fluency is reached. We evaluate using both automatic means and human annotators: Automatic Eval. Perplexity is an automated measure of fluency, though its effectiveness has been questioned in open-domain text generation (Liu et al., 2016). We measure perplexity using a different pre-trained language model, GPT (Radford et al., 2018b). The diversity of text in the passages is measured using the number of distinct n-grams (normalized by the length of text) as in Li et al. (2015). We report Dist-1, Dist-2, and Dist-3 scores for the distinct 1-2-3-grams (measured across all samples generated for a given attribute control task, e.g. a specific topic for topic control). Such  The issue focused  The issue focused  The issue focused  The issue focused  The issue focused  The issue focused  The issue focused  The issue focused  The issue focused  The issue focused  The issue focused  The issue focused  The issue focused  The issue focused  The issue focused  The issue focused  The issue focused\". Both directly optimized (in red) and related words (in soft red) are highlighted, showing how the optimization takes effect. Note that sometimes related words appear before directly optimized words, showing the subtle effect of control.\n[-] The issue focused The The issue focused on the role of social media as a catalyst for political and corporate engagement in the digital economy, with the aim of encouraging companies to use the power of social media and the Internet to reach out to their target market. \\n According to a report by Digital Media Monitor and the digital advertising market research firm Kantar Web.com in January, Facebook has already surpassed Google and Apple as. . . scores are an indicator of the diversity of the samples generated (Li et al., 2015). We aslo use external sentiment classifiers for sentiment evaluation.\nHuman Eval. We consider two types of human annotation: fluency and A/B testing on attribute relevance. Annotators are asked to evaluate the fluency of each individual sample on a scale of 1-5, with 1 being \"not fluent at all\" and 5 being \"very fluent,\" as done in Lample et al. (2019). In the A/B testing for attribute relevance, we consider all combinatorial pairs of all four variants: B, BR, BC, and BCR (6 combinations). We then ask annotators to rank the pair on the desired attribute (e.g. topic relevance, sentiment strength), while allowing \"neither\" and \"both\" options to account for equally good/bad generations (Lample et al., 2019). We obtain annotations from nine external occupational annotators. Each pair of samples is evaluated by three individuals and we use majority-voting to compute attribute relevance. For fluency we use average of the three annotations. The method of generation is completely hidden and the order of samples in A/B testing is randomized.\nAblation study and baselines. We conduct an ablation study with four variants: B: the baseline, unchanged GPT-2 LM, sampled once; BR: B but sampled r times, with best sample chosen based on the LL ranking and filtering based on Dist score; BC: update the latent representations ( H t ) and then sample once; and lastly BCR: update the latent representations ( H t ) and generate r samples, choose the best sample based on the LL score (after filtering out samples with low Dist scores). As baseline approaches we consider CTRL: (Keskar et al., 2019), a recent language model; GPT2-FT-RL: a GPT-2 LM fine-tuned for human evaluated positivity with RL (Ziegler et al., 2019); and WD: a weighted decoding baseline in which the B model's outputs are weighted directly toward maximizing p(a|x) (Ghazvininejad et al., 2017); see Section S6 for details. Hyperparameters used for each experiment are given in Section S10\n\nBOW ATTRIBUTE MODELS\nThe simplest attribute model we use gives the log of the sum of likelihoods of each word in some predefined Bag of Words (BoW). Given a set of keywords {w 1 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , w k } that specify a topic of interest and the output distribution of the language model p t+1 , the log likelihood is: We construct BoWs that represent seven distinct topics: SCIENCE, MILITARY, LEGAL, COMPUT-ERS, SPACE, POLITICS, and RELIGION (see Section S16 for complete word lists). Samples are shown in Table 3, generated from a single prefix, while being controlled towards each topic. Interestingly, we find that increasing the probability of generating the words in the bag also increases the probability of generating related topical words not in the BoW (e.g. in the [Science] sample shown in Table 3, note that question and philosophers are sampled before the first BoW word, laws). Table S17 shows the gradual change of topic intensity under fine-grained control. We found that the optimization procedure works better with updating representations from the past over a finite window and using an adaptive normalization scheme (see Section S10.3).\nFor automatic and human evaluation, we generate 420 samples evenly distributed among seven BoW attribute models and 20 prefixes (see the full list in Section S14), for each of the four variants described in the ablation study. See Section S7 for further details on evaluation and results. Table 4 show that human annotators find text from BCR (51.7%) and BC (46.9%) to be significantly more on topic than B (15.8%) and BR (11.1%). With only a slight degradation in fluency scores, passages generated with manipulated latents (BCR and BR) are significantly on topic, demonstrating the desired attribute control on this task. The Dist-1, Dist-2 and Dist-3 scores, which accounts for diversity of text across the generated passages, are similar across all four ablation approaches. Further, BCR slightly outperforms CTRL (51.7% & 50.0%), and significantly outperforms WD (36 %). It is also interesting that BC itself outperforms WD (36 %). BCR, CTRL and WD all score similarly on the fluency metric.\nWe note that gradient-based latent updates have significantly greater influence on topic relevance (R with or without C) than reranking based on the score (C with or without R), showing that shifting meaning in latent space is more effective than shifting the output distribution directly through reweighting. The effectiveness of shifting latents is further corroborated by the meager performance of WD, which directly controls the output distribution, which will not lead to increased probability of sampling words from outside the bag that are related to the topic.\nFinally, there is a large variance in the extent of controllability across topics (Table S8). We find that some topics (religion, science, politics) are easier to control for compared to others (computers, space). Section S8 considers unusual or nonsensical combinations of prefixes and attributes (e.g. prefix 'potato' and topic 'religion'), and we find that even for these settings PPLM is able to successfully control for the desired attribute, often with hilarious twists!\n\nDISCRIMINATOR ATTRIBUTE MODELS\nWhile BoW models have been demonstrated to be able to control text attributes such as sentiment (e.g., Li et al. (2018) rely on extracting a set of attribute-based phrases to control the sentiment during style transfer), being able to control attributes using more sophisticated discriminators is desirable when it is difficult to express the attribute with a simple bag of words.\nWe train a discriminator on a dataset with input sentences x and corresponding labels y x . For an input x of length t, we compute o x :t and train f on the mean (\u014d t ) of the embeddings across time. All discriminators in this work consist of a single layer classifier that predicts the target label from\u014d x t . The number of parameters in this layer is (embedding-dimension (e) \u00d7 number of attributes (a) + number of attributes (a)), which is negligible compared to the number of parameters in the LM model itself (Table 2). Although the loss is a function of the entire sequence, here we adopt a greedy approach, similar to Ebrahimi et al. (2018);Wallace et al. (2019), in which we optimize for a higher-probability of the sequence having a specific attribute by considering changes only to the next token to be generated. This objective can be described as follows, where f is the discriminator: (6) Note that o t+2 is a function of x t+1 . Further, x t+1 \u223c Softmax(W\u00f5 t+1 ), which depends on \u2206H t . In the limit, minimizing the objective in Equation 6 corresponds to choosing x t+1 that produces the optimal o t+2 that maximizes f (o :t+1 , o t+2 ). However, this limits the diversity of the generated text Table 4: For each treatment in the ablation study, we report mean\u00b1std-dev across (human and automated) fluency metrics. The topic (%) reports the fraction of samples matching the target topic, as evaluated by human annotators. Table S8 provides per-topic results. Approaches BC and BCR demonstrate significant control over the topic of the generated text, while retaining similar diversity (Dist-1, Dist-2, Dist-3) scores and minimal degradation in Perplexity and Fluency evaluations vs the baseline LM (B). The gain from ranking and choosing from multiple samples BR over B is limited (4.7%). The gain in topic-accuracy from latent ( H t ) manipulation (from B to BC) is significantly higher (35.8%). Perplexity is computed using the GPT LM (Radford et al., 2018a), which differs from the LM generating text (GPT-2). For CTRL and WD, since human evaluation is performed in comparison with BCR via A/B testing, we report the numbers for BCR as well from these comparisons, for the human evaluated metrics. Further, we consider one sample per prefix for CTRL, resulting in fewer samples and higher Dist-1, 2, 3 scores as a consequence. PPLM outperforms CTRL and WD on topic-relevance, while being comparable on fluency scores. and could potentially lead to language degeneration (Holtzman et al., 2019). Alternatively, we focus on a softer optimization approach where we aim to shift the distributionp t+1 = Softmax(W\u00f5 t+1 ) towards one that in expectation has a higher likelihood of having the desired attribute a. Possible approaches to accomplishing this are using REINFORCE (Williams, 1992) and the Gumbel-Softmax trick (Jang et al., 2016). However, both of these would slow down convergence. Instead, as in Dai et al. (2019a), we use the distributionp t+1 (instead of a hard sample x t+1 ), and feed it forward to the generate the next embeddings token and update \u2206H t .\nThe sentiment discriminator here distinguishes sentiment between POSITIVE and NEGATIVE and is trained on the SST-5 dataset (Socher et al., 2013). Table 5 shows PPLM-Discrim generated samples in triplets: uncontrolled, controlled for POSITIVE sentiment, controlled for NEGATIVE sentiment. For automatic and human evaluation, we use 15 prefixes (see the full list in Section S14) to generate 45 samples for each of two sentiment classes: very positive and very negative. Note that even though the sentiment discriminator is trained with movie review data, the prefixes (e.g. \"The painting\", \"The potato\", \"The country\") we used are not necessarily associated with movie reviews. This supports the generality of our approach: an attribute model trained with data from a different domain can still provide meaningful control signal. Table 6 shows evaluation results. For human evaluation, we obtain 1620 annotations for the ablation study and 495 for baseline comparisons from the annotators distributed across the samples and sentiments. Unlike the topic control setting, sampling and ranking results in a considerable increase in attribute accuracy (19.3% \u2192 41.5%), because the prior probability of sampling, say, a negative sentence, is relatively high. BC results in a decrease in fluency when compared to B, while being significantly more consistent with the desired attribute (19.3% \u2192 39.6%). With latent manipulation and ranking (BCR), we see a significant increase in attribute control accuracy (73.7%) while retaining fluency similar to B and BR. Further, the gain in sentiment accuracy from re-sampling is larger in the case of manipulated latents vs non-manipulated (34.1% increase from BC to BCR > 22.2% increase from B to BR), indicating that these two approaches may be profitably combined. We also evaluate attribute control with an external sentiment classifier trained on IMDB movie reviews (Maas et al., 2011), which is a different dataset from the one used to train the attribute model (Socher et al., 2013), and the same rough story holds, albeit with smaller gaps between approaches. We compare to baselines CTRL, GPT2-FT-RL, and WD. BCR performs comparably to CTRL (73.7% and 80.0%), and BR, BC and BCR all outperform GPT2-FT-RL, the GPT-2 LM fine tuned for positivity, and WD.

A recent paper by Wallace et al. (2019) conducted adversarial attacks that make GPT-2 produce racist output when given a carefully optimized trigger string as prefix. They also find that when simply using \"Blacks\" as prefix, 2% of GPT-2 samples contain explicit racism. Other prefixes (e.g., \"Asians\" or \"Jews\") are mentioned but no percentage is reported. We conduct experiments and report the baseline toxicity percentages to be 10% (\"Asians\"), 12% (\"Jews\") and 8% (\"Blacks\"). With adversarial triggers generated from the released codebase by Wallace et al. (2019) the average toxicity percentage is 63.6%. Further details can be found in Section S12.\nPPLMs can be easily adapted for language detoxification by plugging in a toxicity classifier as the attribute control model and update latents with the negative gradient. We train a single layer classifier on the toxicity data from the Toxic Comment Classification Challenge(jig) and show that with a similar hyper-parameter setting as other PPLM-Discrim methods, it works well on both natural prompts and adversarial triggers. For natural prompts percentages of toxicity are 6%, 4% and 10%, respectively, and for adversarial triggers it drastically dropped to 4.6% on average, with statistical significance. Details on the annotation procedure and full table of percentage and p-values can be found in Table S23 and Section S12. Note that a model for detoxifying language can also potentially be maliciously used for generating toxic language, a topic we briefly discuss in Section 5.\n\nCONTROLLED STORY WRITING\nWe explore controlled generation for assistive story writing (Peng et al., 2018;Luo et al., 2019;Yao et al., 2019;Fan et al., 2018). Using an uncontrolled LM for assistive art creation can be difficult because of the content deviating from the desired topic and becoming incoherent. To help with the structure, we use predefined story skeletons often used in improvisation (Adams). We fill in the blank between these prefixes with a PPLM. See examples in Table S20 and Table S21.\n\nDISCUSSION\nWe present PPLM, a plug and play method for controlled language generation that allows flexible assembling of a large, pre-trained language model and a BoW or a small, easy-to-train discriminator, and achieves fine-grained control of attributes such as topics and sentiment. Without retraining or fine-tuning the language model, the simple mechanism shows great capability of attribute control while retaining fluency. We believe this method could serve as a simple baseline for the largely open-ended language generation tasks where controlling is challenging.\nThere has recently been a substantial discussion around the ethics of capable language models (Radford et al., 2019;Keskar et al., 2019), both in their potential to recapitulate problematic social biases Table 6: Evaluation of models and variants on the sentiment control task, with mean\u00b1std-dev reported across various fluency metrics. Sentiment accuracy reports the fraction of samples with the target sentiment as evaluated by humans or an external classifier. Approach BCR provides significant control over sentiment while showing minimal degradation in fluency. See Table S9 for full results on individual sentiments. *GPT2-FT-RL is only evaluated for the positivity half of the task, as it is fine-tuned only for positivity (Ziegler et al., 2019). For human evaluation metrics, we compare the baselines CTRL, GPT2-FT-RL and WD with BCR and perform A/B style testing. We include both numbers from the comparison. and for them to be directly abused for societal harm (e.g. to generate disinformation). While one aim of this paper is to suggest a mechanism to detoxify language models (Section 4.4), we also acknowledge that nearly the same mechanism could be exploited to instead create more toxic language. Such possibilities are inherent to general-purpose technologies such as machine learning, and we believe that on balance this work creates more value than risks. We consider three baselines: CTRL, GPT2-FT-RL, and WD. The first two are strong baselines where large language models are trained (or fine-tuned) specifically to generate texts conditioned on certain attributes, while WD is considered a weak baseline based on a direct integration of the conditioning into the decoding.\nFor each baseline, we generate data from their method, and conduct the same human and automated evaluations. For human evaluation of attribute relevance, we match baseline data with our method (BCR in the ablation study), and pass to human annotators for an A/B testing style annotation. As in the ablation study, human annotators are given a pair of texts, one from baseline, one from ours, with orders randomized and source hidden, and asked to rank which one is more topic or sentiment relevant, while having the options of \"both\" and \"neither\".\nOn top of that, we have human annotators to give the fluency score of each text sample under each method individually. And automated evaluations of perplexity, sentiment, etc. are also done individually.\n\nS6.1 CTRL\nThe recent conditional language model, CTRL, from Keskar et al. (2019), trains a 1.6B LM conditioned on around 50 control codes. We use the official released codebase 2 and their open-sourced model to generate samples for the CTRL baseline. Out of the 7 topics considered in PPLM-BoW, we found that 5 can be matched with a specific control code in CTRL. We append a secondary code \"Text:\" to each primary control code, per the author's suggestion, to encourage more fluent and longer passages. The 2 topics missing a match with CTRL are: Military, Space. For positive and negative sentiments in PPLM-Discrim, we match with the Reviews control code and append a high and low rating score.\nThe matched attributes and control codes are listed in Table S7.\nUnder this setting, for each control code we generate texts prompted by the same prefixes used for corresponding PPLM attribute model (20 for PPLM-BoW, 15 for PPLM-Discrim). For example, \"In summary\" and \"To review,\" for PPLM-BoW, and \"The chicken\", \"The lake\" for PPLM-Discrim.\nDue to the near-greedy sampling method CTRL uses, for each prefix it generates one sample. Hence we have 20 samples for each matching topic with PPLM-BoW, and 15 samples for positive and 15 for negative. Christianity Text: POSITIVE (PPLM-Discrim) Reviews Rating: 5.0 NEGATIVE (PPLM-Discrim) Reviews Rating: 1.0\n\nS6.2 GPT2-FT-RL\nA recently released GPT-2 model fine-tuned using human feedback, from Ziegler et al. (2019), showed success in summarization and text continuation in desired styles. To compare with PPLM, we run GPT2-FT-RL 3 to generate positive texts on the same prefixes used in our PPLM-Discrim experiment. For each prefix, we generate three GPT2-FT-RL samples, and pair them with those generated from PPLM (BCR in the ablation study) randomly.\n\nS6.3 WEIGHTED DECODING (WD)\nWe consider a simple baseline based on a direct integration of the conditioning into the decoding procedure, similar to the approach from Ghazvininejad et al. (2017).\nTopic Control with Bag of Words In Ghazvininejad et al. (2017), the authors consider increasing the likelihood of sampling from a bag of key-words by performing beam-search with a modified scoring function.\nit has been shown that beam-search results in degradation of language for GPT-2 (Holtzman et al., 2019), we consider top-5 sampling from a distributionp t+1 defined such that: where \u03c4 \u2208 R ++ and p t+1 is the distribution over the vocabulary as predicted by the GPT-2 LM . For the experiments in Section 4, we set \u03c4 = 10.\nSentiment Control with Discriminator Here, we implemented weighted decoding similarly for sentiment control. Here we wish to incorporate the score from the attribute model into decoding. To control for style\u00e2, instead of sampling from the distribution p t+1 , we sample fromp t+1 defined as: p(a =\u00e2|x 0:t , w i ) is the probabilty of the sequence x 0:t , w i possessing attribute\u00e2 as assigned by the attribute model. By Bayes' rule, p(a =\u00e2; w i |x 0:t ) = p(a =\u00e2|x 0:t , w i )p t+1 (w i ), and we do top-5 sampling from this distribution. Recall that p t+1 (w i ) = p(w i |x 0:t ) under the language model.\n\nS7 FURTHER DETAILS ON HUMAN AND AUTOMATED EVALUATION\nWe conduct evaluations on attribute relevance and language fluency, both including human and automated evaluation.\nFor topic relevance (a.k.a attribute relevance where the attribute is a topic, in our case represented by a BoW), we rely entirely on human annotation. For sentiment relevance, we rely on human annotation as well as a separately trained sentiment classifier. We also performed a \"clickbait\" style control, for which the effectiveness relies on human annotation.\nThe number of human evaluations are as below: \u2022 PPLM-BoW. For the ablation study, we have 20 prefixes \u00d7 7 topics \u00d7 6 combinations \u00d7 3 samples \u00d7 3 labels each, resulting in 7560 total annotations. For baseline comparisons, we have (20 prefixes \u00d7 5 topics) for CTRL and (20 prefixes \u00d7 7 topics \u00d7 3 samples) for WD, each then with 3 labels, resulting in 1560 total annotations.\nIn ablation studies, the generation procedure for BCR, BR and BC is always initiated from the same random seeds. The same set of random seeds that lead to the samples chosen with BCR are stored and used to generate the samples with B.\nThe full table of all these measures, human and automated, on PPLM-BoW, seperated by sentiment and style, is in Table S8. Included also are strong baselines (CTRL and WD) for each sentiment. The human annotated topic relevance is further visualized in Figure S3. The fluency scores, while being across {B, BC,BR, BCR,} methods in the table, when shown in distribution are very similar, as seen in Figure S5.\nThe full table of all these measures, human and automated, on PPLM-discrm sentiments, is in Table S9. Included also are strong baselines (CTRL, WD and GPT2-FT-RL) for each topic. The human annotated sentiment and style (e.g. \"Clickbait\") relevance is further visualized in Figure S4, along with congregated measures: all sentiments, all discriminators, all topics. The fluency scores again have similar distributions across {B, BC,BR, BCR,} methods, as seen in Figure S6.  Figure S3: Topic relevance by human evaluation. We can see that taking a PPLM gradient step (B\u2192BC) makes a big difference. Reranking is mostly helpful (B\u2192BR; BC\u2192BCR). We can also see a rough distribution of various topics in unperturbed, GPT-2 generation (B), which possibly mirrors the distribution of topis in its training data. Some topics, like science, naturally appear rather frequently.\n\nS8 ODD COMBINATION OF TOPICS AND PREFIXES\nIt is interesting to see how PPLM can steer the text generation when the topic and prefix combination appears odd or illogical. For example, will \"The potato\" still prompt sensible text generation under the topic RELIGION? In this study we design a set of odd combinations, as bellow.\n\u2022 Prefixes of {\"The chicken\", \"The horse\", \"The pizza\", \"The potato\", \"The lake\"}, each controlled by topics of {MILITARY, LEGAL, COMPUTERS, POLITICS, RELIGION}; \u2022 Prefixes of {\"My dog died\", \"The food is awful\"}, each controlled by the sentiment of POSITIVE; \u2022 Prefixes of \"The food is amazing\", controlled by the sentiment of NEGATIVE.\nWe found that PPLM control is easy even under those scenarios. We had to increase the strength \u03b1 two or three fold (to 0.02 or 0.03 as opposed to 0.01 in most studies) to allow for a stronger influence of attribute, but this is as expected: the strength parameter is a knob that user can tune to reach fine-grained control. The resulting generation is included in Table S10 -Table S16. S9 FINE-GRAINED CONTROL WITH PPLM-BOW Table S17 shows the subtle effect when you turn the step size \u03b1 up, while keeping everything else (hyperparameters, text prefix) the same.\n\nS10 HYPERPARAMETERS\nWe list, in Table S18, the full set of hyperparameters used in each task in the experiments section, corresponding to results in Table 4 and Table 6, as well as in Section 4.4.

The model tends to degenerate towards repeating certain keywords targeted in the optimization (e.g. words in the BoW). In this case, we can either reduce \u03b1, or use the trick of early stopping latent updates. Table S19. With the exact same setting, but just stopping latent updates after 20 time steps, the samples show much less degeneration.\n\nS10.2 FINITE HORIZON UPDATE\nAs opposed to updating the entire vector H t , which consists of key-value pairs corresponding to every token in the prefix, we consider modifying the key-value pairs corresponding to the most recent w tokens. At each time-step t, we only modify H t [t \u2212 w : t]. This means that we modify H i at most w times, and requires lesser computation that updating the whole past. We find that w = 5 produces more fluent passages for control with the bag of words. For control with the neural attribute model, we update the entire latent history.\n\nS10.3 ADAPTIVE GRADIENT NORMALIZATION\nFor the bag-of-words based attribute model, what we wish to enforce is that a word from the bag appears at least once in the generated passage and not at every time-step. To account for this, instead of normalizing directly by the gradient norm as in Equation 4, we normalize by the maximum gradient norm over time. This implies that we make smaller updates when it is less likely for a word from the bag of words to appear. Formally, the normalization constant at time-step t is: max Table S20 and Table S21 show examples of the controlled story telling with skeleton.

However, controlling attributes of the generated language (e.g. switching topic or sentiment) is difficult without modifying the model architecture or fine-tuning on attribute-specific data and entailing the significant cost of retraining. We propose a simple alternative: the Plug and Play Language Model (PPLM) for controllable language generation, which combines a pretrained LM with one or more simple attribute classifiers that guide text generation without any further training of the LM. In the canonical scenario we present, the attribute models are simple classifiers consisting of a user-specified bag of words or a single learned layer with 100,000 times fewer parameters than the LM. Sampling entails a forward and backward pass in which gradients from the attribute model push the LM's hidden activations and thus guide the generation. Model samples demonstrate control over a range of topics and sentiment styles, and extensive automated and human annotated evaluations show attribute alignment and fluency. PPLMs are flexible in that any combination of differentiable attribute models may be used to steer text generation, which will allow for diverse and creative applications beyond the examples given in this paper.\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) has enabled large-scale language models (LMs) trained on a huge amount of data (Radford et al., 2019;Dai et al., 2019b;Radford et al., 2018b) to greatly improve the state-of-the-art on natural language processing tasks. These models are used to extract contextualized word embeddings for transfer learning purposes (Devlin et al., 2019) and as natural language generators. The latter can leverage large amounts of unannotated data and a simple log-likelihood training objective. However, once such models are trained, controlling attributes of * Work done during internship at Uber AI \u2020 Co-senior authors . \u2022 Summary of contributions: Sumanth, Rosanne, and Jason conceptualized PPLMs and led the manuscript writing. Sumanth led the project, implemented the PPLM, set up and ran all modeling experiments, engineered how to obtain workable gradients via the weighted embedding approach, and made the model work. Andrea helped with preparing datasets for discriminator training, automated evaluation, running experiments, and writing the manuscript. Sumanth, Rosanne, and Andrea ran the external baselines. Rosanne and Janice built and oversaw the human evaluation pipeline and computed the statistics. Jane ran the story generation with skeleton prefixes. Eric assisted with detoxification experiments and drew multiple versions of Wooly. Piero led efforts to migrate to the new pytorch transformer, helped with code release, and Rosanne, Jason, and Piero coordinated with collaborators from Hugging Face to produce the demo. Jason helped with the annotation pipeline, finding bugs, navigating model and experimental directions, engineering workable gradients, and posing the model mathematically. Rosanne implemented preliminary experiments and multi-attribute control, and cleaned and coordinated release of the code. Rosanne and Jason oversaw the project. Table 1: The PPLM employs a pre-trained language model (LM) without any changes to the model parameters and can generate text with controlled attributes such as topic and sentiment. We demonstrate control with two tiny and easy to construct attribute models: a bag of words (BoW) related to a topic and a linear discriminator trained on top of LM latent representations to control sentiment. The underlined prefix is what the LM is conditioned on to generate a passage of text (e.g. The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato). The controlled attributes are colored and bracketed (e.g. [Science] ), and words in the BoW that are directly optimized for are highlighted brightly (e.g. research). The softer highlights correspond to words related to the attribute, but not directly optimized for during the control process (e.g. health).\n[-] The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato The potato and cauliflower are both in season to make combo breads, mounds, or pads.

However, generative models only learn p(x). In computer vision, Plug & Play Generative Networks (PPGN) from Nguyen et al. (2017) developed a mechanism for generating images with different attributes by plugging a discriminator (attribute model) p(a|x) together with a base generative model p(x) and sampling from the resulting p(x|a) \u221d p(a|x)p(x), effectively creating a conditional generative model on the fly from any supplied attribute model. In a similar manner, we propose the Plug and Play Language Model (PPLM) for conditional language generation that combines one or more simple attribute models p(a|x)-either in the form of a bagof-words (BoW) or single layer classifiers-with a pre-trained, unconditional language model p(x). We sample from the resulting combined model by following gradients in the latent representation space in a manner inspired by the approximate Metropolis-adjusted Langevin (MALA) (Roberts et al., 1996;Roberts & Rosenthal, 1998) sampler deployed in Nguyen et al. (2017).\nOptimization is performed ex post facto in the activation space, therefore no re-training or finetuning is needed. Control is fine-grained, with a strength parameter determining how strong the attribute influence should be; a strength of 0 fully recovers the original model p(x). This design allows vast flexibility: users can combine a state-of-the-art generative model, which may be large and difficult to train, with any number of attribute controllers. Attribute models may be easier to train or untrained (in the case of BoW models), and multiple controllers may be combined flexibly during inference. In this paper, we demonstrate the PPLM approach using a GPT-2 345M model (Radford et al., 2019) as the general-purpose LM p(x), but the method applies in any representation space from any transformer-based text generator and allows combination with any attribute model p(a|x).\nWe demonstrate controlled generation with a number of attribute controllers, assembled and combined during generation, each with a different strength, acting as a set of \"control knobs\" that tune generation towards the desired attribute (see examples in Table 1). Code for the models and experiments is available at: https://github.com/uber-research/PPLM. Our key contributions are: \u2022 We introduce the Plug and Play LM for controlled language generation, discuss its relation to existing work, and how sampling from a PPLM works (Sections 2 and 3).\n\u2022 We demonstrate controlling of text generation on a range of attributes, including 7 topics each defined using a bag of words, and 1 simple discriminator on sentiments. We quantify effectiveness using both automated evaluation (separately trained perplexity and sentiment models) as well as human evaluation (for attribute relevance and fluency). All evaluations point toward the ability of PPLMs to generate attribute controlled, fluent text (Section 4).\n\u2022 We compare PPLM with strong LM baselines such as CTRL (Keskar et al., 2019) and GPT-2 finetuned for positivty (Ziegler et al., 2019). Our method, without any LM training, is on par and often outperforms the baselines on attribute relevance and fluency (Section 4.2, and Section 4.3).\n\u2022 We show that the PPLM approach can be used to detoxify certain instances where generation of toxic content is likely by following the negative gradient of a model trained to detect toxicity (Section 4.4). We also show how PPLM can be used for structurally constrained story writing (Section 4.5).\n\nRELATED WORK\nControlled generation Current methods for controlled text generation involve either fine-tuning existing models with Reinforcement Learning (RL) (Ziegler et al., 2019), training Generative Adversarial Networks (Yu et al., 2017), or training conditional generative models (Kikuchi et al., 2016;Ficler & Goldberg, 2017). Different from our approach, these methodologies are not plug and play, since the entire model needs to be separately fine-tuned for each specific attribute. Keskar et al. (2019) train a large language model with over 50 different control codes. The results are high quality because they train exactly to maximize p(x|a), but this comes at the expense of fixing control codes up front and of training a very large model (1.6B parameters). Our method does not require retraining any conditional generative model, and both the language model and the conditional model can be flexibly assembled. Table 2 gives a comparison of recent approaches to language modeling tuned for specific attributes. In another interesting but tangential piece of work, Subramani et al. (2019) recently showed that a pre-trained language model can be steered to recover arbitrary sentences. Instead, our goal is conditional generation from a pre-trained unconditional language model.  (Shannon, 1948) for improving sequence-to-sequence modeling. Their approach translates a source language sentence y into a target language sentence x by first sampling from a forward model proposal distribution p forward (x|y) and then reranking samples based on probabilities given by p backward (x|y) \u221d p(x)p(y|x). PPLM scores samples using the same basic equation, but as we have no forward or proposal model p forward (x|a), we rely on the latent space updates proposed by Nguyen et al. (2017). As a baseline, we consider using p(x) as a \"forward model\" and then reranking, which we will see works moderately well in some scenarios and poorly in others (see Tables 4 and 6).\nWeighted decoding Holtzman et al. (2018); Ghazvininejad et al. (2017) consider controlled language generation -the former with discriminators, and the latter with a bag of words -where the decoding procedure is modified to consider the scoring function used for decoding. See et al. (2019) note that control with weighted decoding (WD) is difficult and often leads to sacrificing fluency and coherence. Further, Ghazvininejad et al. (2017) strongly relies on sampling from a set of keywords on a specific topic and it does not allow to bias generation towards a topic in a manner that does not necessary include a set of keywords. Similarly, Baheti et al. (2018) proposed a decoding strategy for generating interesting responses in dialogue systems, using bags of words and word embeddings. Sophisticated sampling methods (Metropolis et al., 1953) can be used to constrain the model generation to certain keywords and topics. We evaluate WD as a baseline.\nText Style Transfer Outside of language modeling, the field of text style transfer performs a related task. Shen et al. (2017);Hu et al. (2017) train variational auto-encoders for style transfer that rely on learning disentangled latent representations for style and content. Li et al. (2018) demonstrate the efficacy of a simple approach based on replacing attribute related n-grams with n-grams corresponding to the desired attribute based on a conditional generative model. A key difference between the above and our approach is that we use an offline discriminator and perform optimization based on this discriminator, which as suggested by Elazar & Goldberg (2018) may outperform adversarial training approaches. More recently, Lample et al. (2019) adapt an approach from unsupervised language translation to style transfer, where a denoised auto-encoder is trained with an objective consisting of a weighted combination of a re-construction loss and a back-translation loss. While the above approaches have shown impressive success on style transfer tasks, the main focus is not controlled language generation, and further, the methods are not plug and play.\n\nLANGUAGE MODELING WITH TRANSFORMERS\nGiven a sequence of tokens X = {x 0 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , x n }, LMs are trained to compute the unconditional probability of the sequence p(X). This probability can be rewritten in terms of product of conditional probabilities by recursively applying the chain-rule (Manning et al., 1999;Bengio et al., 2003) as: In this paper, we use a transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) to model the distribution of natural language. To present our approach clearly, we first briefly summarize the transformer using recurrent notation. Let us define the history matrix H t to consist of the key-value pairs from the past t ) corresponds to the key-value pairs from the i-th layer generated at all time-steps from 0 to t. Efficient implementations of the transformer (Wolf et al., 2019) use the cached H t to generate x t+1 , given x t . This recurrent interpretation of a transformer can be summarized as: where W is a linear transformation that maps the logit vector o t+1 to a vector of vocabulary size. This allows for efficient language generation without repeated forward passes corresponding to the prior conditioning text x 0 , . . . , x t\u22121 .\n\nSTEERING GENERATION: ASCENDING log p(a|x)\nIn order to control the output of the language model, at every generation step t, we shift the history H t in the direction of the sum of two gradients: one toward higher log-likelihood (LL) of the attribute a under the conditional attribute model p(a|x) and one toward higher LL of the unmodified language model p(x). Combining these factors with a variable multiplier provides us with a controllable \"knob\" to guide generation in a given direction with a specified strength.\n\n{ { {\nStep 2 Step 3 Figure 1: Simplified illustration of the proposed approach in three phases. In Step 1, a forward pass is performed through the language model to compute the likelihood of a desired attribute using an attribute model that predicts p(a|x). In Step 2, a backward pass updates the internal latent representations of the LM, using gradients from the attribute model, to increase the likelihood of the passage having the desired attribute. In Step 3, a new distribution over the vocabulary ( p t+1 ) is generated from the updated latents ( H t ) and the current token x t . The next token is then sampled from the updated distribution. This process of updating the latents is repeated at each time-step, leading to a gradual transition towards the desired attribute. For computational efficiency, one may choose to modify only the latents within some window of the recent past, depicted as the dotted-red region.\n(note that H t is composed of all transformer key and value pairs generated up to time t). Taking steps in H t space leads to gradual changes to model activations -which may be thought of as gradual reinterpretations of the past -that guide future generation in the desired direction.\nLet \u2206H t be the update to H t , such that generation with (H t + \u2206H t ) shifts the distribution of the generated text such that it is more likely to possess the desired attribute. \u2206H t is initialized at zero and updated with gradients from an attribute model that measures the extent to which the generated text possesses the desired attribute (e.g. positivity). We rewrite the attribute model p(a|x) as p(a|H t + \u2206H t ) and then make gradient based updates to \u2206H t as follows: where \u03b1 is the step size, \u03b3 is the scaling coefficient for the normalization term. 1 This update step can be repeated m times; in practice we use 3 to 10. Subsequently, a forward pass through the LM with the updated key-value pairs is performed to obtain the updated logits o t+1 as o t+1 , The perturbed o t+1 is then used to generate a new distribution p t+1 as in Equation 3. 3.3 ENSURING FLUENCY: ASCENDING log p(x) The approach described in the previous section is able to generate text tuned for a particular discriminator, but left unchecked it will quickly result in unrealistic adversarial or fooling examples (Szegedy et al., 2013;Nguyen et al., 2015) as the text moves into low probability regions. To combat this, we use the unconditional language model in two ways that ensure the fluency is maintained at or near the level of the unconditional language model (here GPT-2).\nKullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence We update \u2206H t to minimize the KL divergence between the output distribution of the modified and unmodified language models in addition to the step above. In practice, this is accomplished by adding the quantities together before taking a gradient, though it can be visualized as two separate steps as in Figure 2. We scale the KL coefficient by a scalar \u03bb KL , and in practice, setting this hyperparameter to 0.01 works well in general across tasks. Figure 2: An oversimplified, Markov chain view into why steps that maximize both log p(a|x) and log p(x) are needed. The sentence under consideration is shown as a black dot, which is first pushed in the direction of maximizing log p(a|x) and then in the direction of maximizing log p(x). In practice we use a single step and simply add the log probabilities; we take steps in continuous space of hidden representations H rather than in the discrete x (byte pair) space, and rather than resampling the entire sentence each step, we take one step in H space per byte-pair sample. , where p t+1 and p t+1 are the unmodified and modified output distributions, respectively, and \u03b2 is a normalizing factor such that it forms a valid distribution. As \u03b3 gm \u2192 1 this converges to the distribution from the updated LM, and as \u03b3 gm \u2192 0 it converges to the unconditional LM distribution. We find that in practice values for \u03b3 gm in the range 0.8 \u2212 0.95 work well.\n\nSAMPLING AND RANKING\nThe attribute model p(a|x) in PPLM provides two functionalities: first, a score that can be used to rank samples based on the LL of the desired attribute (forward pass only; Step 1, Figure 1), and second, a gradient ascent direction to perform an update in the latent space (Step 2 & 3; Figure 1). The former can be used to generate r samples and rank them to choose the best one. This can serve as an additional method for attribute control in addition to sampling with updated latents. Further, to avoid the problem of repetitive, low quality text (Holtzman et al., 2018), we compute the mean over the Dist-1, Dist-2 and Dist-3 scores (for the generated passage), which is an indicator of repetitiveness (Li et al., 2015), and then discard samples with a mean score below a threshold \u03c4 .\n\nEXPERIMENTS, RESULTS, AND EVALUATION\nIn this section we describe our evaluation methodology and then show controlled generation results under various attribute models. We also show use cases of PPLM in language detoxification and in controlled story telling. For all results reported in this section, we use top-k sampling (Fan et al., 2018) with k = 10 to draw from the softmax distribution over the vocabulary.\n\nEVALUATION METHODS AND ABLATION STUDY\nWe evaluate to assess two properties: whether PPLM generates text that satisfies the desired attribute (topic or sentiment) and whether the quality of its text deteriorates as we intensify control of the attribute. Note we can always turn the control knob down to zero to disable control of attributes and reach the fluency of the original model. If desired, a user can tune the knobs at inference until a chosen tradeoff between attribute strength and fluency is reached. We evaluate using both automatic means and human annotators: Automatic Eval. Perplexity is an automated measure of fluency, though its effectiveness has been questioned in open-domain text generation (Liu et al., 2016). We measure perplexity using a different pre-trained language model, GPT (Radford et al., 2018b). The diversity of text in the passages is measured using the number of distinct n-grams (normalized by the length of text) as in Li et al. (2015). We report Dist-1, Dist-2, and Dist-3 scores for the distinct 1-2-3-grams (measured across all samples generated for a given attribute control task, e.g. a specific topic for topic control). Such  The issue focused  The issue focused  The issue focused  The issue focused  The issue focused  The issue focused  The issue focused  The issue focused  The issue focused  The issue focused  The issue focused  The issue focused  The issue focused  The issue focused  The issue focused  The issue focused  The issue focused\". Both directly optimized (in red) and related words (in soft red) are highlighted, showing how the optimization takes effect. Note that sometimes related words appear before directly optimized words, showing the subtle effect of control.\n[-] The issue focused The The issue focused on the role of social media as a catalyst for political and corporate engagement in the digital economy, with the aim of encouraging companies to use the power of social media and the Internet to reach out to their target market. \\n According to a report by Digital Media Monitor and the digital advertising market research firm Kantar Web.com in January, Facebook has already surpassed Google and Apple as. . . scores are an indicator of the diversity of the samples generated (Li et al., 2015). We aslo use external sentiment classifiers for sentiment evaluation.\nHuman Eval. We consider two types of human annotation: fluency and A/B testing on attribute relevance. Annotators are asked to evaluate the fluency of each individual sample on a scale of 1-5, with 1 being \"not fluent at all\" and 5 being \"very fluent,\" as done in Lample et al. (2019). In the A/B testing for attribute relevance, we consider all combinatorial pairs of all four variants: B, BR, BC, and BCR (6 combinations). We then ask annotators to rank the pair on the desired attribute (e.g. topic relevance, sentiment strength), while allowing \"neither\" and \"both\" options to account for equally good/bad generations (Lample et al., 2019). We obtain annotations from nine external occupational annotators. Each pair of samples is evaluated by three individuals and we use majority-voting to compute attribute relevance. For fluency we use average of the three annotations. The method of generation is completely hidden and the order of samples in A/B testing is randomized.\nAblation study and baselines. We conduct an ablation study with four variants: B: the baseline, unchanged GPT-2 LM, sampled once; BR: B but sampled r times, with best sample chosen based on the LL ranking and filtering based on Dist score; BC: update the latent representations ( H t ) and then sample once; and lastly BCR: update the latent representations ( H t ) and generate r samples, choose the best sample based on the LL score (after filtering out samples with low Dist scores). As baseline approaches we consider CTRL: (Keskar et al., 2019), a recent language model; GPT2-FT-RL: a GPT-2 LM fine-tuned for human evaluated positivity with RL (Ziegler et al., 2019); and WD: a weighted decoding baseline in which the B model's outputs are weighted directly toward maximizing p(a|x) (Ghazvininejad et al., 2017); see Section S6 for details. Hyperparameters used for each experiment are given in Section S10\n\nBOW ATTRIBUTE MODELS\nThe simplest attribute model we use gives the log of the sum of likelihoods of each word in some predefined Bag of Words (BoW). Given a set of keywords {w 1 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , w k } that specify a topic of interest and the output distribution of the language model p t+1 , the log likelihood is: We construct BoWs that represent seven distinct topics: SCIENCE, MILITARY, LEGAL, COMPUT-ERS, SPACE, POLITICS, and RELIGION (see Section S16 for complete word lists). Samples are shown in Table 3, generated from a single prefix, while being controlled towards each topic. Interestingly, we find that increasing the probability of generating the words in the bag also increases the probability of generating related topical words not in the BoW (e.g. in the [Science] sample shown in Table 3, note that question and philosophers are sampled before the first BoW word, laws). Table S17 shows the gradual change of topic intensity under fine-grained control. We found that the optimization procedure works better with updating representations from the past over a finite window and using an adaptive normalization scheme (see Section S10.3).\nFor automatic and human evaluation, we generate 420 samples evenly distributed among seven BoW attribute models and 20 prefixes (see the full list in Section S14), for each of the four variants described in the ablation study. See Section S7 for further details on evaluation and results. Table 4 show that human annotators find text from BCR (51.7%) and BC (46.9%) to be significantly more on topic than B (15.8%) and BR (11.1%). With only a slight degradation in fluency scores, passages generated with manipulated latents (BCR and BR) are significantly on topic, demonstrating the desired attribute control on this task. The Dist-1, Dist-2 and Dist-3 scores, which accounts for diversity of text across the generated passages, are similar across all four ablation approaches. Further, BCR slightly outperforms CTRL (51.7% & 50.0%), and significantly outperforms WD (36 %). It is also interesting that BC itself outperforms WD (36 %). BCR, CTRL and WD all score similarly on the fluency metric.\nWe note that gradient-based latent updates have significantly greater influence on topic relevance (R with or without C) than reranking based on the score (C with or without R), showing that shifting meaning in latent space is more effective than shifting the output distribution directly through reweighting. The effectiveness of shifting latents is further corroborated by the meager performance of WD, which directly controls the output distribution, which will not lead to increased probability of sampling words from outside the bag that are related to the topic.\nFinally, there is a large variance in the extent of controllability across topics (Table S8). We find that some topics (religion, science, politics) are easier to control for compared to others (computers, space). Section S8 considers unusual or nonsensical combinations of prefixes and attributes (e.g. prefix 'potato' and topic 'religion'), and we find that even for these settings PPLM is able to successfully control for the desired attribute, often with hilarious twists!\n\nDISCRIMINATOR ATTRIBUTE MODELS\nWhile BoW models have been demonstrated to be able to control text attributes such as sentiment (e.g., Li et al. (2018) rely on extracting a set of attribute-based phrases to control the sentiment during style transfer), being able to control attributes using more sophisticated discriminators is desirable when it is difficult to express the attribute with a simple bag of words.\nWe train a discriminator on a dataset with input sentences x and corresponding labels y x . For an input x of length t, we compute o x :t and train f on the mean (\u014d t ) of the embeddings across time. All discriminators in this work consist of a single layer classifier that predicts the target label from\u014d x t . The number of parameters in this layer is (embedding-dimension (e) \u00d7 number of attributes (a) + number of attributes (a)), which is negligible compared to the number of parameters in the LM model itself (Table 2). Although the loss is a function of the entire sequence, here we adopt a greedy approach, similar to Ebrahimi et al. (2018);Wallace et al. (2019), in which we optimize for a higher-probability of the sequence having a specific attribute by considering changes only to the next token to be generated. This objective can be described as follows, where f is the discriminator: (6) Note that o t+2 is a function of x t+1 . Further, x t+1 \u223c Softmax(W\u00f5 t+1 ), which depends on \u2206H t . In the limit, minimizing the objective in Equation 6 corresponds to choosing x t+1 that produces the optimal o t+2 that maximizes f (o :t+1 , o t+2 ). However, this limits the diversity of the generated text Table 4: For each treatment in the ablation study, we report mean\u00b1std-dev across (human and automated) fluency metrics. The topic (%) reports the fraction of samples matching the target topic, as evaluated by human annotators. Table S8 provides per-topic results. Approaches BC and BCR demonstrate significant control over the topic of the generated text, while retaining similar diversity (Dist-1, Dist-2, Dist-3) scores and minimal degradation in Perplexity and Fluency evaluations vs the baseline LM (B). The gain from ranking and choosing from multiple samples BR over B is limited (4.7%). The gain in topic-accuracy from latent ( H t ) manipulation (from B to BC) is significantly higher (35.8%). Perplexity is computed using the GPT LM (Radford et al., 2018a), which differs from the LM generating text (GPT-2). For CTRL and WD, since human evaluation is performed in comparison with BCR via A/B testing, we report the numbers for BCR as well from these comparisons, for the human evaluated metrics. Further, we consider one sample per prefix for CTRL, resulting in fewer samples and higher Dist-1, 2, 3 scores as a consequence. PPLM outperforms CTRL and WD on topic-relevance, while being comparable on fluency scores. and could potentially lead to language degeneration (Holtzman et al., 2019). Alternatively, we focus on a softer optimization approach where we aim to shift the distributionp t+1 = Softmax(W\u00f5 t+1 ) towards one that in expectation has a higher likelihood of having the desired attribute a. Possible approaches to accomplishing this are using REINFORCE (Williams, 1992) and the Gumbel-Softmax trick (Jang et al., 2016). However, both of these would slow down convergence. Instead, as in Dai et al. (2019a), we use the distributionp t+1 (instead of a hard sample x t+1 ), and feed it forward to the generate the next embeddings token and update \u2206H t .\nThe sentiment discriminator here distinguishes sentiment between POSITIVE and NEGATIVE and is trained on the SST-5 dataset (Socher et al., 2013). Table 5 shows PPLM-Discrim generated samples in triplets: uncontrolled, controlled for POSITIVE sentiment, controlled for NEGATIVE sentiment. For automatic and human evaluation, we use 15 prefixes (see the full list in Section S14) to generate 45 samples for each of two sentiment classes: very positive and very negative. Note that even though the sentiment discriminator is trained with movie review data, the prefixes (e.g. \"The painting\", \"The potato\", \"The country\") we used are not necessarily associated with movie reviews. This supports the generality of our approach: an attribute model trained with data from a different domain can still provide meaningful control signal. Table 6 shows evaluation results. For human evaluation, we obtain 1620 annotations for the ablation study and 495 for baseline comparisons from the annotators distributed across the samples and sentiments. Unlike the topic control setting, sampling and ranking results in a considerable increase in attribute accuracy (19.3% \u2192 41.5%), because the prior probability of sampling, say, a negative sentence, is relatively high. BC results in a decrease in fluency when compared to B, while being significantly more consistent with the desired attribute (19.3% \u2192 39.6%). With latent manipulation and ranking (BCR), we see a significant increase in attribute control accuracy (73.7%) while retaining fluency similar to B and BR. Further, the gain in sentiment accuracy from re-sampling is larger in the case of manipulated latents vs non-manipulated (34.1% increase from BC to BCR > 22.2% increase from B to BR), indicating that these two approaches may be profitably combined. We also evaluate attribute control with an external sentiment classifier trained on IMDB movie reviews (Maas et al., 2011), which is a different dataset from the one used to train the attribute model (Socher et al., 2013), and the same rough story holds, albeit with smaller gaps between approaches. We compare to baselines CTRL, GPT2-FT-RL, and WD. BCR performs comparably to CTRL (73.7% and 80.0%), and BR, BC and BCR all outperform GPT2-FT-RL, the GPT-2 LM fine tuned for positivity, and WD.

A recent paper by Wallace et al. (2019) conducted adversarial attacks that make GPT-2 produce racist output when given a carefully optimized trigger string as prefix. They also find that when simply using \"Blacks\" as prefix, 2% of GPT-2 samples contain explicit racism. Other prefixes (e.g., \"Asians\" or \"Jews\") are mentioned but no percentage is reported. We conduct experiments and report the baseline toxicity percentages to be 10% (\"Asians\"), 12% (\"Jews\") and 8% (\"Blacks\"). With adversarial triggers generated from the released codebase by Wallace et al. (2019) the average toxicity percentage is 63.6%. Further details can be found in Section S12.\nPPLMs can be easily adapted for language detoxification by plugging in a toxicity classifier as the attribute control model and update latents with the negative gradient. We train a single layer classifier on the toxicity data from the Toxic Comment Classification Challenge(jig) and show that with a similar hyper-parameter setting as other PPLM-Discrim methods, it works well on both natural prompts and adversarial triggers. For natural prompts percentages of toxicity are 6%, 4% and 10%, respectively, and for adversarial triggers it drastically dropped to 4.6% on average, with statistical significance. Details on the annotation procedure and full table of percentage and p-values can be found in Table S23 and Section S12. Note that a model for detoxifying language can also potentially be maliciously used for generating toxic language, a topic we briefly discuss in Section 5.\n\nCONTROLLED STORY WRITING\nWe explore controlled generation for assistive story writing (Peng et al., 2018;Luo et al., 2019;Yao et al., 2019;Fan et al., 2018). Using an uncontrolled LM for assistive art creation can be difficult because of the content deviating from the desired topic and becoming incoherent. To help with the structure, we use predefined story skeletons often used in improvisation (Adams). We fill in the blank between these prefixes with a PPLM. See examples in Table S20 and Table S21.\n\nDISCUSSION\nWe present PPLM, a plug and play method for controlled language generation that allows flexible assembling of a large, pre-trained language model and a BoW or a small, easy-to-train discriminator, and achieves fine-grained control of attributes such as topics and sentiment. Without retraining or fine-tuning the language model, the simple mechanism shows great capability of attribute control while retaining fluency. We believe this method could serve as a simple baseline for the largely open-ended language generation tasks where controlling is challenging.\nThere has recently been a substantial discussion around the ethics of capable language models (Radford et al., 2019;Keskar et al., 2019), both in their potential to recapitulate problematic social biases Table 6: Evaluation of models and variants on the sentiment control task, with mean\u00b1std-dev reported across various fluency metrics. Sentiment accuracy reports the fraction of samples with the target sentiment as evaluated by humans or an external classifier. Approach BCR provides significant control over sentiment while showing minimal degradation in fluency. See Table S9 for full results on individual sentiments. *GPT2-FT-RL is only evaluated for the positivity half of the task, as it is fine-tuned only for positivity (Ziegler et al., 2019). For human evaluation metrics, we compare the baselines CTRL, GPT2-FT-RL and WD with BCR and perform A/B style testing. We include both numbers from the comparison. and for them to be directly abused for societal harm (e.g. to generate disinformation). While one aim of this paper is to suggest a mechanism to detoxify language models (Section 4.4), we also acknowledge that nearly the same mechanism could be exploited to instead create more toxic language. Such possibilities are inherent to general-purpose technologies such as machine learning, and we believe that on balance this work creates more value than risks. We consider three baselines: CTRL, GPT2-FT-RL, and WD. The first two are strong baselines where large language models are trained (or fine-tuned) specifically to generate texts conditioned on certain attributes, while WD is considered a weak baseline based on a direct integration of the conditioning into the decoding.\nFor each baseline, we generate data from their method, and conduct the same human and automated evaluations. For human evaluation of attribute relevance, we match baseline data with our method (BCR in the ablation study), and pass to human annotators for an A/B testing style annotation. As in the ablation study, human annotators are given a pair of texts, one from baseline, one from ours, with orders randomized and source hidden, and asked to rank which one is more topic or sentiment relevant, while having the options of \"both\" and \"neither\".\nOn top of that, we have human annotators to give the fluency score of each text sample under each method individually. And automated evaluations of perplexity, sentiment, etc. are also done individually.\n\nS6.1 CTRL\nThe recent conditional language model, CTRL, from Keskar et al. (2019), trains a 1.6B LM conditioned on around 50 control codes. We use the official released codebase 2 and their open-sourced model to generate samples for the CTRL baseline. Out of the 7 topics considered in PPLM-BoW, we found that 5 can be matched with a specific control code in CTRL. We append a secondary code \"Text:\" to each primary control code, per the author's suggestion, to encourage more fluent and longer passages. The 2 topics missing a match with CTRL are: Military, Space. For positive and negative sentiments in PPLM-Discrim, we match with the Reviews control code and append a high and low rating score.\nThe matched attributes and control codes are listed in Table S7.\nUnder this setting, for each control code we generate texts prompted by the same prefixes used for corresponding PPLM attribute model (20 for PPLM-BoW, 15 for PPLM-Discrim). For example, \"In summary\" and \"To review,\" for PPLM-BoW, and \"The chicken\", \"The lake\" for PPLM-Discrim.\nDue to the near-greedy sampling method CTRL uses, for each prefix it generates one sample. Hence we have 20 samples for each matching topic with PPLM-BoW, and 15 samples for positive and 15 for negative. Christianity Text: POSITIVE (PPLM-Discrim) Reviews Rating: 5.0 NEGATIVE (PPLM-Discrim) Reviews Rating: 1.0\n\nS6.2 GPT2-FT-RL\nA recently released GPT-2 model fine-tuned using human feedback, from Ziegler et al. (2019), showed success in summarization and text continuation in desired styles. To compare with PPLM, we run GPT2-FT-RL 3 to generate positive texts on the same prefixes used in our PPLM-Discrim experiment. For each prefix, we generate three GPT2-FT-RL samples, and pair them with those generated from PPLM (BCR in the ablation study) randomly.\n\nS6.3 WEIGHTED DECODING (WD)\nWe consider a simple baseline based on a direct integration of the conditioning into the decoding procedure, similar to the approach from Ghazvininejad et al. (2017).\nTopic Control with Bag of Words In Ghazvininejad et al. (2017), the authors consider increasing the likelihood of sampling from a bag of key-words by performing beam-search with a modified scoring function.\nit has been shown that beam-search results in degradation of language for GPT-2 (Holtzman et al., 2019), we consider top-5 sampling from a distributionp t+1 defined such that: where \u03c4 \u2208 R ++ and p t+1 is the distribution over the vocabulary as predicted by the GPT-2 LM . For the experiments in Section 4, we set \u03c4 = 10.\nSentiment Control with Discriminator Here, we implemented weighted decoding similarly for sentiment control. Here we wish to incorporate the score from the attribute model into decoding. To control for style\u00e2, instead of sampling from the distribution p t+1 , we sample fromp t+1 defined as: p(a =\u00e2|x 0:t , w i ) is the probabilty of the sequence x 0:t , w i possessing attribute\u00e2 as assigned by the attribute model. By Bayes' rule, p(a =\u00e2; w i |x 0:t ) = p(a =\u00e2|x 0:t , w i )p t+1 (w i ), and we do top-5 sampling from this distribution. Recall that p t+1 (w i ) = p(w i |x 0:t ) under the language model.\n\nS7 FURTHER DETAILS ON HUMAN AND AUTOMATED EVALUATION\nWe conduct evaluations on attribute relevance and language fluency, both including human and automated evaluation.\nFor topic relevance (a.k.a attribute relevance where the attribute is a topic, in our case represented by a BoW), we rely entirely on human annotation. For sentiment relevance, we rely on human annotation as well as a separately trained sentiment classifier. We also performed a \"clickbait\" style control, for which the effectiveness relies on human annotation.\nThe number of human evaluations are as below: \u2022 PPLM-BoW. For the ablation study, we have 20 prefixes \u00d7 7 topics \u00d7 6 combinations \u00d7 3 samples \u00d7 3 labels each, resulting in 7560 total annotations. For baseline comparisons, we have (20 prefixes \u00d7 5 topics) for CTRL and (20 prefixes \u00d7 7 topics \u00d7 3 samples) for WD, each then with 3 labels, resulting in 1560 total annotations.\nIn ablation studies, the generation procedure for BCR, BR and BC is always initiated from the same random seeds. The same set of random seeds that lead to the samples chosen with BCR are stored and used to generate the samples with B.\nThe full table of all these measures, human and automated, on PPLM-BoW, seperated by sentiment and style, is in Table S8. Included also are strong baselines (CTRL and WD) for each sentiment. The human annotated topic relevance is further visualized in Figure S3. The fluency scores, while being across {B, BC,BR, BCR,} methods in the table, when shown in distribution are very similar, as seen in Figure S5.\nThe full table of all these measures, human and automated, on PPLM-discrm sentiments, is in Table S9. Included also are strong baselines (CTRL, WD and GPT2-FT-RL) for each topic. The human annotated sentiment and style (e.g. \"Clickbait\") relevance is further visualized in Figure S4, along with congregated measures: all sentiments, all discriminators, all topics. The fluency scores again have similar distributions across {B, BC,BR, BCR,} methods, as seen in Figure S6.  Figure S3: Topic relevance by human evaluation. We can see that taking a PPLM gradient step (B\u2192BC) makes a big difference. Reranking is mostly helpful (B\u2192BR; BC\u2192BCR). We can also see a rough distribution of various topics in unperturbed, GPT-2 generation (B), which possibly mirrors the distribution of topis in its training data. Some topics, like science, naturally appear rather frequently.\n\nS8 ODD COMBINATION OF TOPICS AND PREFIXES\nIt is interesting to see how PPLM can steer the text generation when the topic and prefix combination appears odd or illogical. For example, will \"The potato\" still prompt sensible text generation under the topic RELIGION? In this study we design a set of odd combinations, as bellow.\n\u2022 Prefixes of {\"The chicken\", \"The horse\", \"The pizza\", \"The potato\", \"The lake\"}, each controlled by topics of {MILITARY, LEGAL, COMPUTERS, POLITICS, RELIGION}; \u2022 Prefixes of {\"My dog died\", \"The food is awful\"}, each controlled by the sentiment of POSITIVE; \u2022 Prefixes of \"The food is amazing\", controlled by the sentiment of NEGATIVE.\nWe found that PPLM control is easy even under those scenarios. We had to increase the strength \u03b1 two or three fold (to 0.02 or 0.03 as opposed to 0.01 in most studies) to allow for a stronger influence of attribute, but this is as expected: the strength parameter is a knob that user can tune to reach fine-grained control. The resulting generation is included in Table S10 -Table S16. S9 FINE-GRAINED CONTROL WITH PPLM-BOW Table S17 shows the subtle effect when you turn the step size \u03b1 up, while keeping everything else (hyperparameters, text prefix) the same.\n\nS10 HYPERPARAMETERS\nWe list, in Table S18, the full set of hyperparameters used in each task in the experiments section, corresponding to results in Table 4 and Table 6, as well as in Section 4.4. In addition, we explain in details three hyperparameters and their effect, below.

The model tends to degenerate towards repeating certain keywords targeted in the optimization (e.g. words in the BoW). In this case, we can either reduce \u03b1, or use the trick of early stopping latent updates. Table S19. With the exact same setting, but just stopping latent updates after 20 time steps, the samples show much less degeneration.\n\nS10.2 FINITE HORIZON UPDATE\nAs opposed to updating the entire vector H t , which consists of key-value pairs corresponding to every token in the prefix, we consider modifying the key-value pairs corresponding to the most recent w tokens. At each time-step t, we only modify H t [t \u2212 w : t]. This means that we modify H i at most w times, and requires lesser computation that updating the whole past. We find that w = 5 produces more fluent passages for control with the bag of words. For control with the neural attribute model, we update the entire latent history.\n\nS10.3 ADAPTIVE GRADIENT NORMALIZATION\nFor the bag-of-words based attribute model, what we wish to enforce is that a word from the bag appears at least once in the generated passage and not at every time-step. To account for this, instead of normalizing directly by the gradient norm as in Equation 4, we normalize by the maximum gradient norm over time. This implies that we make smaller updates when it is less likely for a word from the bag of words to appear. Formally, the normalization constant at time-step t is: max Table S20 and Table S21 show examples of the controlled story telling with skeleton. Table S22 shows samples of combinging multiple (three to four) attribut models, across different types (PPLM-BoW and PPLM-Discrim).

Potato is widely used to make various products. It is one of the most popular vegetables for use as a food, as a food additive, as an ingredient in cooking methods, and for its use in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals. The most commonly consumed portion is a large potato. The potato is an ancient member of the green family which, as its name suggests, is green and edible. It is native to the Middle East and parts of South Asia. It is an important crop in many parts of the world. The potato, a member of the potato family, has been domesticated for thousands of years. It can be eaten raw and cooked in its skins; it is also used as a starch and is a great source of energy and fiber in many diets and in many countries. . .

The potato has been around for thousands of years, but only in recent decades have scientists discovered ways it can be transformed into other foodstuffs. Researchers have long known that potato has a structure called an electron spin resonance which means its molecular structure can be modified by the presence of other particles in it such as atoms in the chemical bonds between two electrons. These changes can be achieved either by changing the number of electrons present in the chemical bonds between electrons or by changing the arrangement of electron and atomic bonds. In both. . .  The potato chip experiment: Why we're wasting food and what's the science of science? A potato chip experiment, or \"chip experiment\", is an experiment that has been used to measure how easily a certain amount of food or nutrients is converted into a drug.

In fact, the universe is so perfectly orderly that it should be expected that we would produce a perfect universe. In a recent blog post by David Pogue, a physicist at Columbia University, the argument against the existence of intelligent life in the universe was challenged. Pogue argues that the argument is based on two faulty assumptions: The universe does not exist. The universe is not infinite. The universe does not exist, so there are no universes. The universe is finite and infinite. There are no universes.
