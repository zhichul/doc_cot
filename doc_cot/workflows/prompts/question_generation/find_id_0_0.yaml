    Below is the BIBLIOGRAPHY of the paper:

    {% for bib_entry in paper.bibliography %}
      ----------
      authors: {% for author in bib_entry.citedPaper.authors %} {{ author.name }}, {% endfor %}
      year: {{ bib_entry.citedPaper.year }}
      title: {{ bib_entry.citedPaper.title }}
      corpusId: {{ bib_entry.citedPaper.corpusId }}
      contexts: 
        {% for context in bib_entry.contexts %}
        * {{ context }}
        {% endfor%}
      ----------
    {% endfor %}

    Below is the surrounding text of the CITATION you need to match, and the CITATION literal itself:
    <citation_literal>
    {{ citance.citation.literal }}
    </citation_literal>

    Make sure the matching BIBLIOGRAPHY entry has a matching context to the following: 
    <citation_context>
    {{ citance.context }}
    </citation_context>


    Please respond with a json containing the BIBLIOGRAPHY entry that matches the CITATION, in the following format:
    {
      "authors": # authors of cited paper,
      "year": # year of cited paper, the bibliography is only an estimate and could be off from the citation literal
      "title": # title of cited paper,
      "corpusId": # corpusId of cited paper
    }
